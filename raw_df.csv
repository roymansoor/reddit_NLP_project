0,Missed opportunities...,"I want to take a moment to talk about missed opportunities.

In mid November of last year I started talking online with a very beautiful Vietnamese girl. We spoke about music, and movies, and books, and her desire to one day move back to Sydney. Our conversation moved at exactly the same pace. She was intelligent, and kind, and witty and funny...and did I mention beautiful?

Now anyone that knows me, knows that I lose interest in women (and people in general) very quickly if I feel that we are not existing on the same plane... That was not the case with this girl. I knew immediately that I liked her.

So much so, that I did...nothing.

I ignored these feelings that I had because deep down I felt that if she met me in person that somehow she wouldn’t like the real “Justin” outside of my online persona.

She was too perfect, and I am not that lucky.

We would causally talk online from time to time, but never making real plans.

January 21st I mustered up the courage and asked her if she wanted to meet. She agreed and 2 days later we met for coffee. I arrived 15mins late and she was waiting, patiently, casually drinking a beer. It was 3pm. I thought this was hilarious and awesome. We were excited to finally meet and it was obvious. We sat and talked for hours with a sort of nervous excitement.

The whole time I was wearing my sunglasses, not to block the sunlight but instead to conceal my feelings. She asked to see my eyes and I jokingly said, “later”.

We made plans to hangout later that night, but decided to wait... We didn’t want to ruin the moment.

A few days later I went to China to play a few shows. When I came back she was leaving to the North for the Tet Holiday. When she came back I left again. The she left again. Etc, etc.

Now even though we didn’t see each other physically during this time we would always watch each other’s IG stories, FB stories, etc. I would always look to see who watched my stories, just to see if she had. And she did.

Then one day she stopped watching.

I sent her a few FB messages and WhatsApp messages, but she didn’t respond. I called, but she didn’t answer. I thought that maybe she had met someone else or wasn’t interested anymore. This made me sad.

After not hearing from her for a few weeks I made the decision that I would contact her somehow and let her know how I really felt. No games, no bullshit.

But, unfortunately that chance will never come, because yesterday I found that she passed away in a motorbike crash 3 weeks ago...

I can’t help but feel that if I would have told her that maybe this could have been avoided.

If you care about someone let them know, now. Because tomorrow is never promised.

3,My Love is My Own,"My love is my own.

It is most powerful and never ending.

It feels deeply and softly. 

It feels hard and true. 

It carries me forward. 

It holds me back. 

It sympathizes. 

It heals. 

It sometimes hurts. 

It takes me captive. 

It becomes overwhelming. 

It blurs my vision. 

It erases my boundaries. 

It creates me. 

It sometimes feels like the whole of me. 

It runs from me. 

It becomes my knowledge. 

It becomes my physical strength. 

It becomes my weakness. 

It feels like a double edge sword. 

I love love. 

I hate love. 

My love has become chaos. 

It has become questionable. 

It has become uncontrollable. 

It rules me like a parasite. 

My love has taken over my logic. 

My logic has become the victim. 

It has learned to live in the shadow. 

It has become my defence mechanism. 

It has learned to protect me from my love. 

Where there is love, there is no logic. 

When their is logic, my love feels trapped. 

Can these two not find harmony? 

Can I not move forward with both love and logic as my guides? 

Is my love instinct and my logic learned? 

What voice should I trust? 

When my love has created chaos in stirring all my other emotions into fruition, should I then rely on logic? 

Is logic the voice of reason when love becomes too powerful to manage? 

When my love needs a gentle or strong reminder that it is my weakness, is logic there? 

When I have fallen for the lies that love creates. 

When love has taken me captive. 

When my boundaries have disintegrated. 

When I have become lost in what feels completely filling. 

Is it only then that I allow logic to be my guide? 

To love is to give yourself away. 

I have completely given myself away to all that I have loved and love. 

My reality is blurred.

4,The day my stalker became the love of my life. (It’s worth the read),"Things can change in an instant. In one blink of an eye, an entire perspective can reverse. My stalker has followed me around for four years and today she broke through.
 “You should come to the lake,” she told me. 
I tell her “fine” and on the way over I text the countless girls that I thought were better than her. I had no idea what was about to happen. I get there and meet her family, her dad, her mom, Grandpa, Grandma, aunt, uncle and as we climbed her family tree I realized she thought this was more than I did. Later on, her dad asked if we wanted to go on the boat. I said yes yearning to get rid of her family. We unhooked the boat and then we were on our way. just me and her alone on the water. About halfway around the lake I look at her and think to myself
 “wow, it might be time to do this” and without skipping a beat I kiss her. 
Jokingly she looks at me and says, “I don’t like you anymore” 
“And whys that?” I laugh back 
“I promised myself I wouldn’t kiss anyone until I dated them,” she said in a more serious tone. 
“Well let’s change that” 
“No, it’s okay” 
“Yes,” I say and while looking into her beautiful blue eyes I ask “will you go out with me” 
Nearly bursting into tears she replies “yes”
And as I look at her I knew she had been waiting for this moment the last four years, she couldn’t be happier. 
Feeling content I gaze back into her eyes and I felt my stalker turn into my love and my love turn into my life and my life turn into her.

5,Tinder Date to Relationship,"Well..English is not my mother tongue, so you must forgive me if something is not quite right or u can fix me as well.
The story starts from tinder.
I met him from tinder last 6 weeks ago and we are in relationship after one week of dating..
You must think it is crazy ,well yeah so do I.
Before that I did have 3 months, 6 months, 9 months dating and over 2 year casual dating as well. So I can say being in a relationship is not something I believe.
I'm the gal who like to enjoy the life since I'm still young. 
I used to have a crazy idea like ""oh I gonna date this one for (3 months, 6 months, blah blah)"" And I did it. I did dating and relationship like business working. I always like to know what comes next and wanna know the end and pretty much enjoy the power of having control over.
But after I met him, I just feel so relaxed and joyful.
I don't know it is love . But I'm really happy with him and more importantly I'm not thinking much but things are still going in quick but to the right direction.
Sometimes things cone to you when you are not looking for it. And then suddenly you fell in love with it.
Hope you enjoy my story,lol. Not sure it'd catch your attention tho.",love,1551718885,Emmy-Em,2,2,True,2019-03-04
6,Just a way of expressing what I feel since there's no one for me to express them to.,"4th March 2019
I cant describe what im feeling in words. Its like a whole load of happiness spilled all over me, but then again I come to face reality, she's not into me, I'm just a fucking best friend that helps out with everything and is always there for anyone at anytime, but whenever I need someone by my side I just find myself all alone. She's the girl I've loved for two years, and I couldn't tell her that I left the other girl because I was still in love with her, I've drawn dreams of our lives that are just dreams that won't come true. I hated getting this close to anyone because I knew this was going to happen, but she needed me, she needed someone to give her all his time after her breakup. Thing is the relationship that she was in was not real, it was slavery, by all means. He would give out orders just like someone does to a slave, but at the end of the day it was a ""sired bond"" that was holding them together, not love. People don't understand the real definition of love. Love is a word that has to be prohibited to use for these types of people.
Ever since my last relationship I set out a rule for myself: Never get this close to anyone again. And I was happy with that, up until they broke up, and that is when she needed someone by her side. I've been by her side ever since the day I got to know her, too bad I fell in love with her. As soon as my love for her was slowly fading away, we got even closer for the past month, and I've loved her more than ever, to be honest, more than the first. I hate this feeling, I absolutely hate it, just loving someone so much that you can't stop from keeping them off your mind, but then when reality kicks in, you know what you're truly worth to other people. Whenever she's happy, everyone steps in, whenever she's depressed and lonely, only a few people are truly willing to give her their time and effort of comforting her. But I guess that's how life just is, I thought I was stronger than love for a little while, turns out I am no match to love. Haha, I really want to cry all my sadness out but I truly forgot how crying works, believe it or not, not a single tear since forever. Problem is I love too much, once I have a person in mind, there's no coming back. I would dream of our house, jobs, nights, haha even kids, but after all they're just dreams that will not become reality. ",love,1551720961,BaladKhales,5,1,True,2019-03-04

14,Drowning my loneliness in meaningless relationships and stupid mistakes.,"I'm on mobile so apologies for any mistakes, also this is gonna be kinda long, just a heads up. 

I'm not totally sure where to start, I think I realized I desperately needed a place to go to rant and maybe receive some much needed advice. 

Growing up I've always been an emotional person, and that showed in all my relationships, both romantic and not. I had a tendency to put a lot of myself into something, investing a significant amount of my emotional energy into other people. In junior year of high school this resulted in my first real girlfriend, I'll call her K. I was stoked to finally have someone to love and kiss and cuddle, someone who could be genuinely happy to be with me for who I am. We were happy, our honeymoon phase lasted about a year and a half making us a giddy cutesy couple. We had a lot of baby names and little things we did that we thought were the absolute cutest. We posted about each other all the time, bragging about how we were happier than everyone else and how we were going to be together forever. When high school ended and we graduated together we began talking about marriage within a few years. She was going off to school (her family luckily could afford to pay for her) and I was going to be taking time to save money. But something I didn't expect from her living on campus and suddenly being away is that I hadn't really been alone in a long time, with her being away and not having time to talk to me anymore I found myself thinking a lot about myself. This lead to a period in my life where I became severely depressed. I suffered through her first year of school, doing my best to support her dreams and goals while trying to hide how sad and broken I had become. Not that I blame her being at school in any way, looking back I was already dealing with those feelings I had just been covering them with the excitement of love. 

So when she came home from school to find that I had been jobless and suffering in my depression she was shocked and didn't know how to handle it. We started fighting a lot about stupid things. I would get jealous over nothing, she would get mad over my lack of motivation, neither of us trying to understand the other in any way.  But still we stuck together because we wanted to try and fix it. I still thought she was the one. After a summer of fighting and pretending she left for another year of school which hit me even harder this time. I spent a few months trying desperately to find something to help me feel better. This is when I tried marijuana for the first time. It was like magic to me, I hadn't felt relaxed and happy like that in over a year, so I started using regularly. K grew up Christian in the kind of household that think marijuana can kill you so her finding out I started smoking became a massive fight between us. She refused to believe it helped me and I refused to to understand her fears of me becoming dependent. Eventually as I'm sure you can expect thing ended between us. There was no build up, no feeling of an impending break up. I remember going out to dinner with some friends and just realizing that I wasn't going to be happy with her anymore. So I ended things. I called her and told her she should come over the next day. She cried a lot, I cried a lot, she didn't understand and had thought things were good between us. This was in July of 2018.

The day after the break up I hooked up with a different girl who quickly became what I call my transition GF, who I'll call KB. This girl was exciting and new, she was sexual and experienced and brave and confident and everything I could have hoped for in a rebound. Her and I started off purely physical, which was nice since I has just gotten out of a relationship and didn't have the emotional capacity to do that again. But as one would expect we caught feelings anyway. We talked about it and agreed to end things before the feelings got too much. That lasted about a week before she texted me saying she missed me and I said the same. So we tried a relationship. We went on day trips to the beach or the mountain, we had a lot of crazy sex, we shared small whispers late at night about how much we loved each other and how scary it is but how beautiful it felt. In September she decided she really wasn't ready for a relationship and it had been a mistake and I accepted that despite it hurting.

 I got on tinder for the first time and luckily quickly found a girl to talk to, I'll call her T. T was so cool, had a 22 tattoos and 8 piercings, she was beautiful and tough and smart and sarcastic and interesting. Her and I hit it off really well, we threw jokes and teasing comments back and forth all the time, stealing cute kisses in between and we decided maybe we should be in a relationship. This is where I made some massive mistakes. KB texted me saying she missed me and wanted to meet up again. Being the idiot I was I agreed and met up with her knowing well enough that I had a new girlfriend who deserved better. But that didn't matter because I wanted more. When KB and I met up we ended the day in another night of passionate sex. I cheated on T with her. I didn't tell T. KB didn't know T existed and wanted to maybe try a relationship again and of course being the idiot I was I agreed. And the thing is I knew at the time that this was wrong, I just chose to ignore that fact. I was convinced i could balance it long enough for one of them to leave on their own or something stupid like that. Anyway this continued for about a month before T told me she had to move about 4 hours away and wanted me to come with her (I've had a tense home life my family disagreed with how I lived my life at the time, which was fair on their part I was just being immature). I agreed and cut things off with KB. Right after I ended things KB found out about T and how I had been with her the whole time. KB messaged T on Instagram and laid everything out for her to see. T was reasonably pissed. She ended things with me.

For the next two weeks I was alone, and because this was the first time I had been really alone in about 3 years the depression came back and it hit me really really hard. That added on to the realization of the mistake I had made, with all that guilt and anger towards myself made life hard. I quit my job because u couldn't get out of bed, I stopped talking to friends and going out. Eventually I made an attempt on my own life. Luckily it didn't work and I recovered fairly quickly. I realized after that that maybe I needed to be alone and I could get passed this period in my life by focusing on myself. Then KB messaged me again. She had heard about the attempt and wanted to check on me, she wanted to meet up. I instantly forgot about focusing on myself and being alone. We started hooking up again, once again I was drowning the pain I felt in someone else's affection for me. This went on for a while and I thought maybe things would be good. Then K, my first girlfriend, texted KB. K started telling lies about who I was and the kind of things I did. Of course I didn't get a break, I probably deserved something else to break us up. Eventually, right before Christmas, things between KB and I ended. They ended peacefully. New years was approaching, I was on tinder but I had my heart set on starting 2019 on my own to represent the growth I would need to make before finding real love. 

Then I met H. H was a hippie, she loved the world and nature and peace and love and wanted to share that love with everyone. She wanted to share that love with me. We spent new years together sharing a new years kiss and she spend the night at my house for a few days. After those days ended she disappeared and I never heard from her again. It caught me off guard that she ghosted me like that, that she had preached love and happiness but acted in selfishness and secrecy. But I took this as the worlds way of confirming that I need to be alone. 

This whole time K was posting about me, about how much she missed and loved me, then about how much she hated me. Her parents would text me checking in, asking if I was ""Sober"" (K had told them I smoked weed and they thought I was going to die or something, my smoking habits were under control by this point). Despit that though I started making huge leaps in progress, I was writing more, playing music more, smiling more. I was becoming ok with who I am and discovering who I want to be. Then at the beginning of February an old friend hit me up, her name is B. B is someone who I knew when I was with K. B was sexy and funny and mean but in a hot affectionate way. We hung out and ended up hooking up.

Now at this point in my life, about a month since that began, B and I still see each other on weekends. I find myself wishing I could handle a relationship right now because I dont want to lose B. But her and I have agreed that that's a bad idea for both of us (she had also recently gotten out of a relationship). I know she talks to other guys and stuff like that and I'm okay with it (I have to be okay with it since I have no right to not, I never bring it up and never make her feel less for it) but u still find myself wishing for more. I realized when I woke up this morning to the weight of that loneliness, that for the last 6 or 7 months I've been covering all of my pain and suffering by sleeping with women and trying to find ""love"". That I have this intense desire to not have enough time to think about myself. When I have moments alone in the dark I think about all my exes, about all the good and bad things that happened, how I blame myself for hurting so many people. I hate myself in a lot of ways for the way I was, and the things I did. I'm glad I've been through so much and that I could learn so much, but its hard, and even though the right answer is probably obvious, I really dont know what to do from here. I'm lost and afraid and I feel so alone.

Sorry for how absurdly long that is, if you got this far thank you for reading, I know I have time because I'm so young, and I also know there are others who feel this way. I just needed a place to let everything out, if anyone has questions please ask, I'm sure there are things I forgot to add seeing as it's a lot.

19,Need Advice,"I've \[M/25\] had a crush on someone from my college (from the same course but in a different class) and had feelings for her ever since. In all the 4 years of college, I've never managed to approach her or anything until the last months of our senior year when I asked one of her friends to hand her some flowers. After graduation, I managed to get the courage to text and chat her. Although we texted nearly everyday, our conversations were not so deep and were just about her interests. This went on until just this January where she opened up and shared her problems (it was about getting dumped) to me to which I became happy since our conversations got a bit more substantial.

After that time, we talked about how we never interacted in college but she remembered the flowers that I gave her which is nice. Then just exactly a week ago, I was at the mall (to buy stuff) which is quite close to her office and texted her that I was in the area. Then, I jokingly told her that I was also there to see her. I wasn't anticipating that she'd be okay to hang out with me on that day and without any plans whatsoever. I was so happy and surprised that she'd agree to that. We ate at her favorite restaurant and chatted the whole time and I felt that we were starting to know each other more and that her ""walls"" are starting to break down. 

TL;DR, I've never been in a relationship before because I'm to shy to approach girls and in the moments that I do, I always get ghosted (I'm pathetic, I know) . I really love this girl and I hope she'll become my first (hopefully only) girlfriend. I know that you should just follow your heart when it comes to these things but I always feel so inadequate or have negative thoughts plaguing me that she's just being nice to you or something.

21,I don't know how to talk to my ex-girlfriend who is my first love and some strange story about us,"First of all,  I'm not in any relationship and my ex is single. This is the most recent situation I'm going to talk about. I had a meet up with a primary school teacher which she(my ex) arrange. I did talk to her time to time but not in like real talk just short unimportant conversation. And the things is that I still had a feeling for her and she is my first girl. And I cannot make a conversation with her (we use Line). What I feel is that I want to be with her again but I don't want to ruin the miracle that she even come back and talk to me like this again. I mean it hardly anyone who relationship before and broke up will be able to talk again like nothing happens. And I treasure that so much. For all the time since broke up about 4 years, I try to forget her but she comes back and talks also I cannot forget her even see in my dream. Let's just say that I lovestruck her and want to be with her again. Back to the recent event when we met I thought that this will be the closure to try to forget her but no when I saw her after a year since her graduation I was stunned. I cannot take my eyes off her. Then after meet up over she drive teacher home and she asks me to come with her. I was confused by the time. When a teacher at home we are alone two of us in her car. She was going to study abroad in Canada for 6 months at least. Normally I don't really care to others. I grew concern and did ask how she going to do there which is ok in my opinion, after all, we already 25. She even drives me to my apartment. During a short period of time, we spend in the car we actually make a conversation but mostly about her time in Canada, driving habit and what she did here. After that, I get in my room confuse and happy. I already miss her smiles in the car. 
   So, I want to go for it I want to be in a relationship again not because I was lonely but I really think she's the one but again I'm so awkward when using Line like I don't know what to talk to her but if talk face to face is ok.  

In case someone asks how you guys break up it was in the first year of college. I was possessive, strict and overly protective. She's blow out I blow out and gone a separate way. I try to keep her out of bad things like drinking and go to a club at night. And she is my first at almost everything we did kiss and almost have sex. Then I change college to another one to suit my preference in English, not Sport-science. That ended our 2-3 years of us then. 

And about a year later she calls me on the phone crying because her new boyfriend is a jerk. I did tell her to break up if it's not ok. And that's it she did Line me time to time or I did but not much conversation going along. And like that about her graduation, she calls me again to her photo shoot that is where I knew she has a new boyfriend at the workplace in a hotel. I was down and did ask her about her new love. All she said is it was good and he did take care of her. I didn't ask any more because I was waiting all this time for her. Then a year later she Line me asking me how I am. And she was break up again and about to quit a job. I was having hope but during that time I start talking to another girl but not really work out. After that we exchange Line but like I said before I can't make a conversation work out and ended in awkward. Which lead me to try to forget her but never really work then I met her as the story above. 

My question is long but I really need advice on how to make a smooth conversation and being in a new relationship. Also, she will leave on the 16th of April 2019. I'm ok with a distance relationship after I made so many mistakes to her I know to make space for other to do as like.

25,I love this girl but she has a boyfriend.,"I met this girl senior year of high school.  Her boyfriend and I used to be good friends.  I know she thinks I’m a great guy,  but her boyfriend is so damn rich I cannot compete with him.  They go on trips across the globe quite often.  

Senior year they broke up and I took her on a date and he found out.  She told me we had to stop because of that and shortly after they got back together.  

We’ve been hanging out a lot lately and we always have so much fun together.  We go out and party with my friends a lot.  We all get along very well.  She invites me over to her apartment but doesn’t ever tell her boyfriend.  

Couple weeks ago we got drunk and she (jokingly) told me she loves me and misses me a lot.  I spent the night over there too but didn’t touch her or do anything.  I just love her company.  She makes me food a lot whenever I’m over.

This weekend she got drunk and started crying because apparently if she even talks to another guy her BF gets angry with her.  I’m not sure if she’s happy or not with him but I don’t want to stir up drama again.  She doesn’t tell him that we hang out.

I do love this girl, I think about her often and think she’s amazing. She’s beautiful, funny, smart and kind.  She’s everything I could ever want, and she makes me feel special just talking to her.  She gives me a look in her eyes that I never have gotten before.  Whenever I show her girls I’m talking to she judges them and tells me I can do so much better, almost in jealousy.  She’s wanted to see my tinder and wants to know about my love life even though it’s non existent because I’m too busy with other things.


Should I stick around and hope my luck changes or cut my losses?  What do you think?  I have plenty of options but I’d never settle for anything less than her.  Whenever I think of what’d I want in a girl I think of her.  I feel like in the long run I’m just f***ing myself up.  Who knows?",love,1551755123,Garspachomapesco,2,1,True,2019-03-04

29,Fell hard for a long-time friend. Cautiously optimistic about the future...!,"Hi! New to reddit, just wanted to tell the story that brought me here.

Long story short, I broke up with my girlfriend of 3.5 years in early January because I realized on New Year’s Day that I had fallen desperately, head-over-heels in love with a friend.

He was a huge help and comfort to me through the weeks after the breakup. The weekend that it happened he actually let me stay the night at his place, in his bed (!!!!!), out of 100% platonic love &amp; support. I know that sounds unbelievable but trust me when I say he is literally just that much of a stand-up sweetheart of a guy. That kind of behavior is exactly why I found myself in this position in the first place lol.

I decided to keep it to myself for a couple months so I could process my feelings more and focus on school. But I finally told him about my feelings the other day, and after thinking it over he said that he’s willing to try.
We both agreed that I need time (at least another month) to keep working through my breakup, and there are some major difficulties with long-distance during the school year that I have no idea how to fix. But right now it feels so good just to know that he finally knows, and especially to know that he’s interested too!!! Now I just need to figure out how to focus back on my studies without getting distracted thinking about his cute scientist butt every two seconds.

Here’s to getting the h*ck out of a dysfunctional relationship and chasing your bliss. 🍻",love,1551764794,gollygollyoxenfree,0,2,True,2019-03-05
30,Transguy that fell for a straight v religious woman,"I'm a transguy, about to start taking hormones again, this time going for full tretment w my family support, I'm mid twenties, still figuring things out in life and how to make a living on my own, I'll finish college later this year, hopefully, if all goes well I should find a decent enough job with my degree next year, ready to make ny own living. 

There's this girl, woman actually, I fell for, we met online around late November if I recall correctly, we talked a lot on voice chat along with other people, I basically joined this group of online friends that game together, then we started talking some more around January when we exchanged numbers.

She kicks ass on fps shooters, though we met on a cowboy simulator game through a friend in commom
 She can be a bit of a sore loser if we're getting our asses kicked, which is understandable, but I find it hilarious and adorable nonetheless.

 We get along great, she's the kind of person you can talk to for hours and not see time fly by, she's funny, sweet, witty, can be straightforward and has a beautiful heart, and my God, she is beautoful.
And her voice, and her laugh...

You get the picture. Ok. Focus.

When we first started talking she didn't know I was trans, she was the first one of the group I came out to, and was super supportive of me back then, one of our friends in commom said they tought we had some sort of chemistry when we talked to eachother on groupchats, now they're not so sure anymore since I came out.
 I don't know, I wouldn't know, I'm not very good at picking up signals.

We haven't been playing as much bc she's back to work, but we still text and sometimes voice call eachother, I usually text more, she responds when she can, as we agreed bc her work routine, she calls me mostly on weekends or when she's working from home.
The thing is, she's 9 yrs older than me, and very religious, she has a very busy life with her work, studies and church, she seems to have life figured out unlike me.

My friend (same mentioned befote) thinks it wouldn't work bc of me being trans and her religious views, that even though the person I like is my friend, we talk and get along, she wouldn't date me bc of my ""condition"", bc she couldn't feel attracted to me knowing I'm trans.

That may sound harsh but I know it's a reality, and quite possible...

But I try to choose to believe the best in people, especially in this case, bc from what I've seen and got to know of her, that seems the right thiing to do.

Am I being too naive to think she could ever like me back despite it all? 

I really like her as a person, and I'd love to get to kbow her better, be that as a friend, or if I'm very, very lucky, as her partner.

Sorry for the ramble, I just tought it'd be worth to give it a try and see what strangers on the internet think. 

Any tips or advice? Anyone ever been in a similar situation?",love,1551765329,ghostofblackfyre,2,5,True,2019-03-05
31,To that guy...,"When I meet you, I felt nothing, I saw someone who was a little bit like me. And we become friends, I would jump with every message, I would be the girl with a silly smile. Then it hit me I have fallen for you, the one at the beggining when you flirted with me, I stoped you because I didn't wanted to get attach because I knew you  would be troubles. But my head doesn't tame my heart.. And yep, felt in love with u anyway, then his attentions and his time become my daily happiness. But then something happened... Something change and I didn't know what was it, you said was depression but I knew there was something else, or someone else... I asked because I rather know and step a side that been cheated... But at the end I knew something was off... And yes, you had someone else. 

So to that guy, you broke me, I don't think I wanna love the same way, cos it's too damn painful... I told u so much stuff, I would have never said to some else, now I have truth issues because I believed on u, for 2 years and u lie to me for 2 years. I hate u because I see your name everywhere, and i hate u, because nothing is the same, the things I used to do with u, reminds me to you, I can't watch my series because we can't discuss then ... I hate that I miss all about u, and that u broke me... I am fuxking 32 years old, and I cry over u like a teenager when I hear something related to you. I am broke on so many ways, I use to be so happy, I would dance and sing everyday... And now I force myself to do it.

Right now,I would be preparing ur present for ur birthday, even if u never even said a proper happy birthday to me, I know I was stupid in love. I still bargain to myself that I was the asshole, for leaving u. But I know was the right thing to do for myself. I wasnt happy anymore, I would be stress to see you, because I would feel anger for the way u treat me. But I do miss been ur bunny and ur weirdo... But wasn't special for you that how u called all your girls. I wasn't special enough.

33,why is love beautiful?,"love as we perceive it to be, is beautiful. Also hurtful many a time. But we can't stop ourselves from falling. Can we? Love is an emotion that every one of us have felt at some point in our lives. Why do we keep going back to such a strong emotion again and again, even after it hurts us sometimes? That's probably because love is also something we crave. How much ever the previous one has hurt you, the moment you see someone new, who you think can fill the void that the previous one has created, you forget all the hurt that the previous one has caused you because you believe that this is going to be different. You want to believe that this time, it will all be different. And most of the times, it is different. Different maybe good or bad. And the cycle keeps repeating itself till you find the one for you. 

And when do you find the one for you? When you know for sure what you deserve. and that you know only when you know yourself well. 

I think that's why love is beautiful. To find love in someone else, you need to know yourself well first. You need to find love in yourself. Once you do, loving another person is something that you'd do effortlessly!

Love is beautiful because it teaches you about yourself, how to know yourself better and love yourself. ",love,1551768672,xx_ham_xx,1,3,True,2019-03-05

35,Being Emotional,"You were an unusual person. Never stuck with the crowd and often tried to defy people's expectations. That was your best quality. Being excited about the most medial things kept you interesting.

You made the day special just by the way you would say hi. You would wave with enthusiasm, go for a really tight hug, or even jump on me like a koala.

Seeing you was special everyday. You always had something to talk about, or an insult to tease me with. You could always get a giggle or smirk out of me when I was having a bad day.

You were a little crazy too. How you always wanted to use Japanese slang. How you would make obscure references or called me wired names. Your underground personality is something that I was always envious of. Being unable to fully understand you.

But that was one of the more darker parts of your personality. You could always keep a secret. You can put on facades just to try and make my day better.

When you are having a bad day, getting you to smile is too easy. When your having a bad day, making conversation seems shallow and scripted. When you are having a bad day, getting genuine emotion out of you seems guarded, like I'm not allowed to know how you feel.

I want you to tell me what gave you a bad day today. I want you to tell me all the secrets that you don't want to keep. I want to make you smile on the worst day of your life. I want to share these emotions with you.

Happiness isn't the only emotion a relationship relies on.

He loves me when I’m sad, angry, happy and all the in betweens.  He is patient and gentle, and does more for me than I deserve. Selfless doesn’t begin to describe him. I adore every day I spend with him, and since moving in together over a year ago, our relationship has only grown stronger. I never get sick of him.

42,My really cringy and looooooong story about how coward I am to tell my best friend I love her. ❤️/💙,"So, as for everything has to be an asshole that creates a problem out of nowhere, here I am. 
My """"story"""" begins around September of 2015, the school classes had just begun, and I was with my circle of friends, talking and stuff, but there was this new girl (there were a lot of new classmates but she called my attention) and we were seeing each other constantly, days passed and we started to meet each other, we started being good friends, but I always had the feeling that I didn't like to her so much, but months passed, she got her boyfriend (4 years older) but that didn't end well. So in supplementary classes, we started to get along reeaally well, I used to go with her to her house and spend some time in there, watching videos or movies, and that was a (basically) daily routine, (we have to remark that I always feel something for her, but not as such intensity), around a year later the whole class went on a trip to a water park, where all of us had such fun, except for me, I was a little heartbroken after watching her kissing with a complete asshole just meters away from me, where I wasn't able to do anything else besides smiling, it was the first time my chest hurt that bad, situations like this repeated in class, pretty much exactly the same scenario, and as well, it didn't end well, she was really bad after having the idea that she was a toy that everyone can play with, so I did my best to reconfortate her, and I don't know if I did a good job, but I did my best, then only I had to do a really loooooooooong homework so I can pass to the next year, and meanwhile I was doing this, she was the literally only one that text me about how much she loves her band, conspiracy theories, etc. But that was the thing that helped me to get trought it. And we're I found that I was actually so fallen in love with her, but I simply don't know how to act like that, so I kept with my mean in the good sense personality.

(There was this time where I told her about an old friend of mine that passed away, and it ended up telling how much I appreciate her and that she is the ""2nd best person that I've ever met, we both ended up with some tears in our eyes and hugging so hard to never let go, she said in that moment that she said ""Te quiero"" (""I love you"", but not in the romantic meaning) which almost tears me apart, and we said goodbye with me kissing her forehead, I wanted so hard to kiss her lips, but as I said, I'M THE MOST COWARD PERSON EVER. That situation sealed up our best friends contract)

Then when we started college, we were in separated classrooms, but in the recess time I always went to her class and spend time with her, some of there thought that I was her boyfriend. In half year was an incident with some classmates (Some murder attempts, normal in this country I guess) so I was given the choice to swap classrooms. I obviously went to hers, there was always a lot of laughs with mainly her and the other classmates, who were good people, I sitted aside from her, so we were always talking.
UNTIL someone needed to fuck it up everything. Yes you guessed right, ME. There was where my depression begin to pronounce himself, but it wasn't nothing that I can't handle by myself, at that moment. I was started to feel bad with everything, condemning my existence responsable of all the bad things that happen around me and the ones I love (short list), so I decided to tell her that I liked her this whole time, as I supposed to make her see how of a bad friend I was, not the case I think. When I told her the words ""I like you"", she was atonished, and didn't said anything. This happens a Sunday, the next Monday we talk not normally at all, Tuesday we didn't talk at all, and in the recess a classmate asked her to be his boyfriend, she said yes, I felt so bad that I had to ask permission to go home. Wednesday we only make eye contact, and two months straight we weren't able to see each other face at all, have on mind that I sated aside her, so watching the kissing from askance...

The in a party i hited my head very hard, and she asked if I was OK, it was a yes and we started talking normally like anything had happened, I went to her home and everything went back to normal. But I still loved her, no matter what, so she ended up with that boyfriend, then started some sort of relationship with our instructor, a program that we were, so watching them kissing, sometimes touching, and even going upstairs (but nothing like that happened) was the worst experience, but what can I do about it?

So here we are, none of us have a romantic relationship with no one, we are still the best friends, but I went to a different college so is a little hard, but I still make contact with the other college since I'm also was upgraded to instructor along with her, and we give classes about disasters.


In less than a month I will start my appointment with the Psychiatrist, and I'm going to do my best to change, don't forget about the hidden depression of mine that never left. I'll try to make a better path, so I decided that before all of this take place, tell her all of the stuff that I'm saying, declare my love for her, but the main point is if she wants to still make contact with the actual me and the one that is near to come, if she stills wants to be with me or if she wants to cut off everything until now and forget about me, but I supose either choice I'll probably just kill myself, depending on the situation, but that's another story, I'm not so sure about it but is the less painful path for me because as I told you:
I
AM
A
COWARD. 

At the end I think that I only needed to share this with someone else, and who's better to do this than the internet, probably the worst choice that I've ever made, or the best. 
So, I would like to know what do you think about the decision I'm about to take, or what 

Psdt: I really, reaally sorry for the writing mistakes that I must made but English it's not my mother tongue, so I would thank you so much if you apologize me for each mistake I made writing.

Love yourself, that's the main point.

44,My Tinder Experiment,"This is my first time posting on Reddit, so be gentle 😂. If this isn’t the right place for this, then redirect me. Anyways I’ll just tell this as a story. I’ll edit this as the story develops. There will be no tl;dr version. But you can skip through the ___ separated parts. There is however a philosophy part that’s at the very bottom if that’s what you came to read. Which I know is what this community focuses on.

So here’s the story.

Some background first:
I’m not too good looking in my own opinion, but I’ve had a fair amount of people taking a fancy to me before. Currently I’m in college. So I’ve been snooping around, but haven’t found the right one yet. So I decided to go to Tinder.

I’m pretty self conscious, and I wasn’t sure what to expect. Posted my pictures, some selfies and some of what I like to do. Ex: animal lover, skiing, etc. In my bio I put the rest, my descriptions, interests etc etc. I put more down than the average profile. I think I only got around 10-20 matches in that profile’s lifetime. Some never responded, but most just gave 3 word answers and didn’t seem interested. It was more of a interrogation by me it felt at times.

One stood out though. We ended up talking, we snapped all the time, and after about a month of getting to know each other, we made plans to go out for the first time, we lived sort of far away so this was kinda big. We had both deleted Tinder by this point. A couple of days before though, without a word, she blocked me on every site we friended on. This sucked, but it happens and it wasn’t that big a deal. So I gave up and decided to try to find someone at college like a normal person.

No luck here. Had a crush on one girl, but was completely shut out by my best friend. He asked her out and got rejected. After that he basically guilt tripped me into not making a move on her. So I didn’t in respect to him I guess. A bit later I started talking to another girl on campus. We hung out and were always talking during class. That same best friend caught on, acknowledged it and said to go for it. Fast forward a few days, he’s snapping me a bunch of pictures of him and her hanging out. He later told me straight up that he was chasing another girl, but he wanted to fuck this one first. That was last year, we aren’t friends anymore. Not because of that, but that definitely sowed the seeds.
____________________________________

One day I got the idea to start an anonymous Tinder account. Not a catfishing one, but just a single profile picture of text saying to read the bio for something real. The bio says:

 “Message me first something amazing about yourself, I doubt there’s nothing 🤘. I’m tired of this world obsessed with appearance, I’d much rather fall for the one who’s soul catches my eye, not their face. Maybe that person will be you? Take a chance, it’s always fun to stray off the beaten track and meet new people 🙂. What have you got to lose?”

And pretty much this was what I believed in. I wanted to see if there was anyone out there with true similar beliefs. The results though, aren’t very good and I have lost most of my faith in humanity because of it. This is depressive work, I highly recommend you do not do this, it’s also agonist tos for experimentation, but that wasn’t my intention so for me it wasn’t.
____________________________________

Here’s what happened.

I wanted to meet as many people as I could, meaning I’d swipe on everyone in my feed. That way I could get to know them and see what they think. I’ve gotten over a hundred matches. In a very short amount of time. Maybe 30% never replied and 10% just asked what I looked like. The ones that did, told me their passions and interests. And it was amazing to see how complex and diverse the human race can be. I would exchange heartfelt opinions on matters of true love and romance yada yada.

Anyways they would all agree. They all believed everyone was obsessed with appearance and no one cared about personality anymore. And they didn’t care what I looked like, hot or not, that they would want to base a relationship on connection.

(Side note: all of the women that I talked to had said that I was the most genuine they’d ever met on there. Going on to say that most of the guys jump right to sex or hooking up and that they want to be seen more than just a piece of meat.)
___________________________________

So 5 made it to the final stretch:

One was genuine, but she had very low self esteem and said that she didn’t care what I looked like after revealing. No compliment after I revealed though, despite me complimenting her a few times (She was not very attractive). After that she only seeked validation from me, and asked if I had lost interest in her already after only a few hours of not responding. But the opposite happened and after a while she stopped talking to me.

The second was different. She found me genuinely attractive and even sent me a few compliments, unless she was lying (I had asked for the brutal truth, over a white lie). I won’t go into detail, but she has bad experience with guys and wants someone genuine that will treat her right. A bit after the reveal though, she seemed distant and uninterested. The conversation became one sided, so I just gave her an escape pass and told her to tell me when she’s ready to meet up. Haven’t heard from her since.

The third was a sixteen year old girl who faked her age. She seemed interested and wanted a genuine relationship, but she’s only sixteen so I had to unmatch her. That may seem rough, but a large age difference at my age isn’t a good thing.

The fourth went similar to the first. She said she found (my race) to be attractive, but when I revealed myself, she didn’t comment much. Afterwards she seemed distant. I can’t read text body language, but I think she was disappointed.

The last one was the most interesting. She seemed the most genuine over text and I really fancied her the most. She was very interesting. Didn’t have much of a profile picture of her to see too well (so maybe she has the same idea). She went on to say she wanted a guy that would treat her right and appreciate her. And looks were irrelevant, all that mattered was who I was as a human being. Going to Snapchat, she said not to rush it if I wasn’t too comfortable. But I felt she deserved it and she stuck out as genuine. I asked for the brutal truth rather than a white lie again. And I sent her the face reveal. I was blocked on Snapchat and unmatched on Tinder almost immediately.
_________________________________

From what I’ve learned, and here’s the hard philosophy behind it. This does not account for everyone, but a vast majority.

We can’t escape biology. We are slaves to it. Driven by an urge to find some more attractive than others, it is what defines our feelings for people. In other words, the Halo Effect is behind the gears of love and romance. We fool ourselves to think we base our ideas of love on an altruistic foundation, and think we’re better than the stereotype. We think it’s about the soul and forming deep connections. But that is merely what follows appearance. A sliver on the pie chart of what we really look for. But I cannot blame people.

The difference between men and women is that the men are upfront about it. While the women put up a facade of what they think they believe to hide their true beliefs, no matter how subconscious.

In other words, we all believe that we are different in that we have truly genuine values for what to look for in a date: funny, easy going, caring, emotional, supportive, etc. But in reality we all seek that hottie across the room that may or may not fulfill our desires. We don’t care. We try to fill in the blanks as we go. It has and always will be about sex. We cannot escape it.",love,1551808652,CrunchyOrangutan,3,7,True,2019-03-05

i’d like to discuss the erotic, but the thoughts gathered for it are lame and constricted.  it’s not because i have an idea of decorum, nor is it due to this mixed company, it’s really the sweat of those acts that are denigrated and tossed on the pile of what is illicit.  i’d like to discuss the carrion entanglements that brought me and my lovers to the brink of rabidity through auto-exotic incision.  musicians and writers of dense prose can get melodramatic with their exaggerated sexualized egos.  it fattens the calf.  and exonerates us from society’s wrath.

before i present myself for slaughter, or hand myself over to an audience of none, the critic that is my better half resists the temptation to bury the fun and allows the freedom to loiter.  here’s the thing.  i’m bound to myself, whether i like me or not, i’m ensconced with my library of social diseases.  extra hours spent living won’t release me from the character i live and breathe in.

49,Is falling in love a decision?,"A little story why I ask, but not absloute necesarry to read to answer the question:

&amp;#x200B;

So, i know her, B., for about 20 years now. We instantly connected on an intellecutal level back than when we were teenagers. We hang out together from time to time, had a lot of meaningful conversations, went on every other weekend or so to parties. But there's never been more than friendship.

A year later i got into a relationship with a friend of her, T., for almost 7 years. In this time B. and I haven't had contact due to a misunderstanding on my side, thinking she had motivated my T. to cheat on me (which was not true as I found out recently).

The relationship with T. broke up 11 years ago. In those 11 years B. and I had very lose contact. I always tried to interact with her, meet her, making plans with her etc, because she has become the only person I can have really deep and meaningful conversations. We both are heavy thinkers, controlled by our brains, not by our hearts. But unfortunately she very often canceled / didn't response for unknown reasons back than. So, we usually saw us about 3-4 times a year on average, sometimes with very long breaks in between.

We both suffer(ed) from depression and anxiety, those were the reason for her cancellations / not responding as I learned recently. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the last 11 years I haven't had any intimate contact with a girl. I was not able to somehow develope romantic feelings for anyone and I'm definitely not the macho or hook up guy. Somehow I simply couldn't cope with the break up. Depressions and anxiety kicked in and I went to therapy for 4.5 years. In general, I'm a shy and rahter introverted person. As I put quality over quantity by far I only got a few solid social contacts, getting fewer as time passes by. Loneliness becomes a growing fear inside of me.

&amp;#x200B;

Since about half a year our contact started to grow again, out of the blue for me. I didnt trust her on making plans for meetings anymore and didn't put a lot of meaning into the contact because of her extreme unreliability. But she didn't sop contacting me, more and more. She had a very bad time. Her mom started to suffer from an very rare disease and she couldn't cope with this situation anymore. Additionally she got in a very weired kind of relationship with a guy where she didn't really know if she wants it and if he wants it. Those ping-pong relationship, sure you know that. She finally quitted it 4 months ago. In this time she coped all that with heavy drinking (which she normally does not), smoking (which she had quittet for years) and Ganja. Of course that made it worse.

&amp;#x200B;

So, since about middle of Jannuary we have contact every day. We see about 2-3 times a week. At the beginning, for me it was a growing friendship, intesivying more and more as we discovered a ton of similarities and interrests. I somehow was not sure anymore what I should feel about that, I started thinking about her more and more. As a brain controlled guy, I did it the ""scientific"" way: I drew up a checklist about what I would expect from a deep-love relationship. She exceeded every single point by far. 

About a month ago we went out for a walk. She pulled me aside and told me that since we have a close friendship, things turned better for her. At first she saw me as a normal friend, but now she recognized my true being as she now can see inside of me. I am healing her. She made me great compliments about my character, how i handle different situations and so on. This flipped a switch inside me. I played with the thought of how it would be if we had a romantic relationship (which I wasn't able to imagine for 11 years). I started day-dreaming about it. Aaaaand stopped that, because we are ""just"" friends. Aaaaand started again because its beautiful. Played the ping pong game a likkle while.

After a couple of days I realized that this wouldnt help at all and leads to nowhere.

68,My favorite love story to tell!,"My parents love story. It played out like many 80s-90s type of high school love story. And it eventually led to me and my two sisters. I've heard it from them, aunts and uncles, grandparents, cousins, and friends of my parents, so this is a cullmination of those.

Basically, my dad was your typical nerdy kid. Wasn't picked on or anything, but his group of friends were the nerds. Very smart, didn't dress the best, loved comic books, and overall just did nerdy things. My mom, on the other hand, was one of the most popular girls in school. Blonde, wore nice clothes, pretty. The mean girls; only they weren't really bullies. They dated football/basketball/baseball/wrestlers and partied hard with the rest of the cool kids. They were the girls the nerdy guys dreamed of dating and the nerdy girls dreamed of being but both knew they never could. This is where the tides turn.

Beginning of senior year, my mom needs a tutor for one of her classes that she was on the brink of failing. The teacher gave her the names of students in her class that had the highest grades, that way she could ask for help from them. Who's at the top of the list? You guessed it: good ol dad. The way my dad explained it, the next day in class, the seat next to him was empty and she sat next to him and asked if she could tutor him. He kept it cool (according to him. My mom said he was a nervous wreck, but for plot purposes, we'll pretend he was cool) and agreed. He ran home that day and told his older brother, my uncle, about it, to which he told my dad just play it cool, be himself, and don't change a thing about his personality. That advise would turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to him.

The tutoring starts and my moms grade in the class start rising. She described the sessions as amazing. She couldn't believe how funny he was. And she found his interests funny. It soon became a close friendship where they'd hang out outside of tutoring. My dad would drive her to the movies, bare with her while she shopped, and best of all: showed her his comic books (per her request.) My mom was open about it. She'd talk to him a lot in school, much to the dismay of her ""friends"". Prom was around the corner and my mom didn't have a date, so my dad took a huge shot in the dark and popped the big question. She leaped into him and gave him a huge kiss and repeated yes over and over again. The kiss stunned my dad, as that was his first ever kiss. But nonetheless, they were the happiest they could be.

NOPE. My mom's friends wouldn't allow him to come to come to the send-off (where all the friends would meet up, take pictures, and leave for prom with their dates). My mom was completely stunned. She knew they were the popular kids, but they were never bullies, at least she wasn't. They way she put it, two things enraged her: the fact they refused to let him come even though that was her date, and how cruel and close-minded they were all being. When she told my dad, he simply asked,

""So what're you gonna do?"" to which she punched his shoulder yelled,

""I'm going with you, you fucking idiot."" And smiled at him.

She went with my dad to his send-off with his nerdy friends and their dates, which were all nerdy girls. From what they tell me, my mom had a ball. The girls liked her and my dad recieved many props from his friends for going to prom with her. At the prom, my mom kept getting stares and tried to shrug them off, but she became overwhelmed. My dad grabbed her by her hand, left the prom, and bought her a soda and some candy to calm her down, then proceeded to drive to an abandoned building they frequented who's parking lot was always empty. They talked and talked for hours, aided by the fact that both of their parents expected them to be at post-prom parties. They skipped their respective parties and talked for hours. The more I get older, the less I believe talking is all they did, but I don't dwell on that. My mom recalled that she didn't sleep that night. All she could think about was that nerdy kid who she'd grown to love.

They graduated high school and attended college together. The relationship survived 4 years of college and they moved in together. After a few more years, he popped the big question: asking for her hand in marriage. Much like the prom proposal, she lept into his arms and kissed him while screaming yes repeatedly. They got married, then proceeded to have my two sisters (twins), and lastly me. I'm 30 now, and they are still together and happier than ever.",love,1551894894,iLikethissubx2x,1,6,True,2019-03-06

&amp;#x200B;

So basically this story happened when I was in middle school. In my country the elementary school and middle school were connected so instead of having separate 4 grades and then move to another school we would have 8 grades. (I don't know how the system works in the US or UK so don't judge me if I got it wrong.). So basically I got a crush on this girl in 2nd grade, I'm going to name here Ashley. So I had a big crush on Ashley from 2nd to 6th grade. We didn't really start talking to each other until 3rd grade. Basically everyone in my class (about 20 to 25 classmates) knew I had a crush on her. Me being the annoying little sh\*t that I am I chased her around the hallways as a joke. Me being 8 I didn't understand that she was annoyed. In 4th and 5th grade I saw that she was annoyed by that and I started being nice to her. I occasionally gave her compliments and made jokes that would sometimes make her laugh. But the peak was in 5th grade. In our school we have large desks that can fit 2 people instead of one. We could only decide where we want to sit at the start of the year but after a week we would get separated from our ""deskmates"" because we would talk in the class. To prevent this from happening we would get seated with a girl because guys usually didn't talk to our girls since they thought they were fat. So one day we had a reseat (basically our seats would get changed) and I got seated with my crush. She would often talk with me in class since we were so close. We started talking more and became really good friends. In the start of my 2nd semester on the 14th of January I started thinking about asking her out. On the 24th of January I asked her out, she rejected me. I was heart broken went home crying. My mum tried to ask me what was wrong but I said I stubbed my toe on a pole. I know that people should get over rejections and 1 crush isn't a big deal but I really loved her. I accepted that she was never gonna be with me. Still, why? I was nice to her, I gave her compliments, gifts, flowers, helped her with her homework and studied with her before a test. I didn't mention this but I had big breakdowns when I was a kid. I once threw a school desk over, because the teacher ignored me the whole day and didn't wanna say anything to me while I didn't understand something related to the subject. I often would cry because I couldn't control myself, it even gotten so bad I cried everyday in school. It didn't help that I was being bullied because of my long hair and people saying I am a whimp for crying and that real men don't cry, I just couldn't stop. This bad reputation stuck with me till 5th grade. I decided to cut my hair and trained my self to not cry and it worked, I trained my anger issues and I got mad in school 1 time and cried only 2 times whilst other years I would cry over 50 times and get enraged every single day. I thought I had improved, but people still judged me for who I was before, I brat with no manners. I think that was the main reason Ashley rejected me, because of my past, she didn't wanna be seen as a girl who is in a relationship with ""that guy"". I thought she also would have gotten bullied so I decided to suppress my feelings for her acting like I wasn't in love anymore. Eventually my reputation got better and people respected me more and didn't judge me as much as before. I thought now is the perfect opportunity to change something, to be with her, later I realized she had a big crush on a guy in 8th grade and I gave up. I still get sad to this day, thinking ""why was I a little brat?"" and that if I wasn't who I was back at the time that if I would have a chance with her. If I could rewind time I would change myself and be more normal not only for her but also for myself... At the end we are really close friends and still hang out to this day it does hurt a little being around her but I am okay with that. ",love,1551906789,TheMlgEagle,0,1,True,2019-03-06
72,What is going on?,"Let me start off by saying I don't know if this belongs here but I really need help and have no one I can talk with about this stuff.

This will be long so buckle in...

Im a male university student and met an amazing girl (lets call her P for this story) at the start of this school year. When I met her, I had no idea I would fall for her, or anything of that sort would happen, but I wanted to be friends. We started slowly, talking about mainly school, work, and other general things...nothing personal at that point, but then we got around to talking with each other pretty often about non-school things. Everything from our day, to memes, to discussing our pasts. And started talking all across the day - early morning to late at night (not continuous talking obviously) - And just like that, without realizing I had fallen for her. Now let me say that it was her who messaged me first, it was her who asked if i wanted to have lunch with her first, it was her who did all of that. Like I said I had no intent on being anything more than friends or acquantainces. So months passed by, still talking everyday, still sharing memes everyday, still sending each other selfies on snapchat every day, etc, etc. We even talked about some really deep topics like what is love, shared more interesting details of our past, talked about our families, etc. in this time. So it was going great! I was in love, but not just with her physical self (although she is very beautiful) but her strength of character, morals, thoughts, etc. Basically she was someone I wanted to eventually marry.

Now before we go further, let me say that she obviously does have other guy friends who she might have shared some of those things with as well...IDK.  I also had a gf for a very brief time in highschool, and I had told P all about it.

Now, cut to about a week ago, the talking suddenly stopped. Nothing but the occasional picture of her dog on snapchat that she sent to probably 50 other people. She stopped seeing me in school and everything basically came to a grinding halt. I didn't try to initiate a conversation either thinking that she might need some alone time (Its stressful exam season in uni and everyone needs space at times). But when this dragged on for 4-5 days I was like what is going on? Why is she suddenly like this? I tried asking her but she just brushed it off. That brings us to today. It's been a week and we just haven't talked.

I hadn't told her about my feelings yet because I wanted to spend more time with her and get to know her more. But I'm sure she had a hint because I did say some things to her which would give her an idea. This didn't affect our friendship at all though.

So my question is, What is going on? What do i do? I don't want to lose P. Like I said, I have tried talking to her but it didn't work.

Any advice would be really welcome and appreciated!",love,1551916953,sillyme_sillyme,4,2,True,2019-03-06

74,Does that type of true love seen in “Titanic” exist? - My Story,"My love story was like Jack and Rose on the titanic.

We met unexpected on a voyage across the same polar icecaps not far from where Titanic ended its course. Maybe there’s something magical about the area, I don’t know. However, we stuck side by side and connected on a really deep level. Everything was natural about it - no dating games, text messaging... no, this was the real deal and the course took its innocent path. It was something I can’t describe because I never had that with any other human being on this planet. Sexual attraction and exploration did not even happen the first year, and I say that as that often blinds people to the development on next level - it was that connection that we had to have each other side by side like meant to be. There was so much happiness. We later lived together, got a dog, and it felt inseparable. One day, a tragic event happened where she was almost killed and I found her and held her last breath before she fell into months of coma and had slim prognosis to live.

Her body took a big toll as I did mentally witnessing this trauma, and time after. She survived but it was so acutely severe, that she went through extensive physical and psychological treatment and recovery. Unfortunately a part of moving us forward from this traumatic event was starting a new life. It was truly horror and terror what happened that day the incident happened to both me and her, and it was so sudden and unexpected. Our goodbyes were the hardest we ever had to give. And I know anyone reading this may have judgements, but this wasn’t a decision we wanted, but based on what we knew was best for us to live past this tragedy. We did this for each other out of love since we knew it was the best for each other. I do not want to share the nature of the trauma or what happened, but this was a decision we had to accept with professionals and recovery of such an event. 

It’s been a year and she has a new humble life away. As part of her recovery, she had to leave all her friends or anyone associated to the town the trauma happened.

I tried to move on and I did. I was a guy that once wanted to have a family with a settled home. However, the idea of that completely throws me off today. People told me to date and that it will make me happy again. It was awful. Even models or kind intellects - I never gave up, but nothing came even close. It was like black and white. I actually found much happiness in choosing a life of being forever single only because I’ve already had that satisfaction of unconditional true love in my life. I honestly don’t want more or anything different because what I had came so spontaneously and was so perfect. The people we were died the day of the tragedy. We will both never be the same person. 

People say being single will make me lonely for life. However, after experiencing true love like that, the energy is so powerful, I can take a pause and reminiscence the happiness that fills my heart like portrayed by Rose so many years later in that film. 

I share this for hopeless romantics or people still looking out there. Or maybe you are in a relationship but you’ve never felt that level of connection. I can tell you it does exist and it makes total sense why philosophy calls it a mystery. I can truly see how a lot of people dating or married out there live sexually and in close friendship. But then there is a deeper level fewer have actually experienced. You don’t have to fight for it. We never did. We just knew since day one. It was mutual. We didn’t even have to say, “ok now we are dating,” or “ok now we are partners.” We just knew because the language of love speaks louder than words. It’s so powerful it still speaks years later after tragedy or death do us part. God and/or the universe bless! ",love,1551923858,spreadinghappiness2,0,1,True,2019-03-06
75,Does this make me a bad boyfriend?,I’ve been head over heels in love with my current girlfriend for the past 10 years. For the last 3 of that she was married and has just recently decided to separate from him. We are now together and quite happily. Today while I was on the phone with her she told me that her ex husband had just texted her that their “Book of Mormon” tickets were for tonight and they had discussed when they separated that they would still go. I couldn’t help but feel a little jealous that she was going to be around her ex doing something that they use to do together while she was with me. After the show she texts me and tells me that everything went great and that the show was amazing then asked me if she could go out for ice cream with him (she’s my sub as well that’s why she asked first) I wanted to say no so bad because the idea of her being around her ex husband without me there drives me insane.....does that make me a bad boyfriend?,love,1551929317,EchoHipHop,12,1,True,2019-03-06
76,I think I’m losing feelings for my girlfriend and falling for my old crush again,"I have been with my girlfriend for 5 months now and it has been amazing. In the beginning it felt kinda one sided but that was because she was still getting used to being in a relationship, but recently she’s been really loving and affectionate.
Then I realized something. So before I dated this girl I had known this one girl. So long story short I liked her and she like me but I didn’t know that she liked me back. Since I didn’t think she liked me, I stopped talking to her to try to forget about her. This ironically is when she lost feelings for me. A couple months later I still couldn’t get over her and decided to confess. She told me how she used to like me and lost feelings when I stopped talking to her. This broke me, and for a while I was hung up on her wondering why I didn’t tell her when I had a chance. 
Fast forward to now, I now realize that the whole reason to get in the relationship I am in now was to get her attention. I wanted to make her jealous. I would try to make sure she would see me and my girlfriend by walking by where she usually hangs out. When I first was doing this I thought of it as revenge for the broken heart she gave me, but now I realize it’s because I still like her.
I really don’t know what to do because the more I’m realizing this, the more I’m starting to lose feelings for my actual girlfriend.
I’m afraid I’ll lose feelings for my girlfriend and breakup with her just to like someone I have virtually have no chance with.

80,The want to be with someone,"          I'm 22 years old and I lost my virginity about 2 years ago. In that time I lost it to a great friend, met someone who I fell head over heels for (which ended badly), hooked up with a few more girls and the last two were not too great. While hooking up with these girls things made an unexpected turn. I couldn't maintain an erection anymore. I was worried at first about health issues so I did what I could to resolve the. I went from watching porn and jerking off 21+ times a week to 3-4 times a week. But I realized that it wasn't my health it was my emotions. 

          I never fully realized until now how important an emotional connection was for me. I'm not meaning to sound cocky but I know I can get very attractive girls and that I had. But no matter how great the sex was or how attractive they were if there wasn't an emotional connection I didn't care. I've gotten to the point in my life where I don't even want hook ups, the idea sounds fun but I already know what's going to happen. I miss have a genuine connection with someone, as fun as sex and all that stuff is I love the idea of waking up next to someone special. I want to spoil that person in everyway I can. I've never even had so much as a Valentine, all I want in this world is to have feelings for someone and give them the love and attention I never felt. 
 
       When my ex and I had dated I remember how I didn't give two shits about about any other girl. All I could think about was her beautiful face. I just miss those feelings, I know I'll meet the right person one day but sometimes it just feels like it will never happen. I honestly spend most of my time alone but I love the thought of being with and around a significant other. What's your guys' experience with dating and all that sort of stuff?

83,Just a story on how I met my boyfriend if that’s interesting,"When I was 8 years old I got into semi professional go kart racing. Not like when you go to a track and rent a kart for the day, we owned the kart, took care of it, took it to the local dirt track etc. My dad and I had no idea what we were doing, I crashed my very first time. Lots of crying. Within the 3rd race, our go kart wouldn’t start. My dad was getting angry  and stuff until another father came over and checked out our engine and gave us a spare part to fix it. Another 2 or 3 weeks later that father came to our house to help my dad out with working on the kart, he brought his son with him. We went upstairs to play video games and he was the funniest person I had ever met. He was so goofy and adorable. Right before he left I straight up told him that I liked him right there. He didn’t really like that XD. But we kept talking. I’d only see him in the summer time when we were racing. I’d look forward to the summer every year just to see this boy for 3 months. Throughout the years we’d date people, I always noticed he dated one kind of girl, blonde, short, girly and basically not me. About 3 years ago I got an xbox one which was the console he had. We started to play every day, eventually we became best friends. He referred to me as his sister he never had which is very funny to joke about now. He had a very long term girlfriend and I figured it was best to move on completely. I had never really dated a guy for a long time. I started dating a guy who was abusive and controlling, for some reason stayed with him for a year, he cheated on me with his ex and I finally left, I felt broken. I asked my best friend to come to my sisters wedding just to have someone my age to talk to, I’m 16. His girlfriend told him to have fun on his little date, told him he didn’t care because she was going to ask him to see a movie and he should’ve known. He started to cry, eventually after a week of trying to work things out, he came to the wedding. After the wedding, they had a huge fight and he broke up with her. I finally told him for the second time in 8 years that I liked him more than a brother. That’s when everything changed. He told me he loved me. We started talking and going on dates for a month or so. Then he asked me to be his girlfriend at my favourite race track. We’ve been together for only 7 months now but I thought the story itself would be something nice to share. ",love,1551962715,TeamSynergyy,3,7,True,2019-03-07

86,Am I reading into this?,"There’s someone I’ve been pining over for literally years!  We crossed paths first in college when I worked the circulation desk.  They would always smile and wave to me, which isn’t particularly strange for most well mannered people.  And I don’t believe in love at first sight or anything like that.  

But there was this immediate magnetism that drew me to them.  We didn’t get properly acquainted until after college.  She turned out to be proximate to a lot of friends of mine when we were there, but our schedules were very different.  We started texting and talking a whole lot!  I even went up to NY to see them more than once.  I was crushing very hard at that point.  They are very sweet and caring.

  Since that time (three years ago) I moved twice and lost touch for a long time.  Out of the blue, in the wake of a separate break up, they reached out to see how I was doing! And slowly we began to fall back into our special friendship; texting, sending each other letters and little trinkets.  It felt really good to reconnect.

This time we’ve really started to talk about more “intimate” emotional subjects.  The types of things you wouldn’t necessarily air out to any old friend, and I’m grateful to be held in that kind of esteem.  Our letters have begun to be more regular!

A few weeks ago they sent me a card for Valentines Day.  It had a woman winking on the front saying “I’d be your valentine, quick as a wink”.  It sent my head spinning.  In the past they had been dating other people and vice versa, so it never seemed like a good time to broach my feelings for them.  And I’m still hesitant to say that this was a pass at me!  But this whole relationship thus far has had a tinge of cosmic fate to it.  We made plans for this weekend so I’m going up to see them.

I’ve decided to address my feelings with them, but I’m curious if I’m mistaking friendly gestures for genuine interest.  What are your thoughts?",love,1551983937,Tongy1993,3,2,True,2019-03-07

I've failed to be truly interested in her and to support the weight of her intelect and emotions. I just feel so isolated and not enough. I don't know how to love myself and can't even imagine how to forgive myself. I don't even know if I will ever be capable of loving well.  I never thought I'd see the failure of us.

In high school he’d do this goofy face where his top and bottom lip go the opposite way and he’d open his eyes all the way.

He hadn’t made that face in years. But the other night, our kids were at his parents house, and we decided to have a little date night at the house. We were slow dancing to music when he said my name, and when I looked up, he made the face. It looked the same as all the years before and made me flashback to prom night when I was dancing in his arms. 

It’s safe to say that I burst into tears. Seeing that made me realize how long we’d been together and how much we’ve grown since then. And that after all those years of high school and college, he’s the only man for me. ",love,1551987194,Omg_throwaway5434,3,11,True,2019-03-07

After a few weeks I realized I made a big mistake. I got over her ex and was ready to date her again. But she wasn’t. She couldn’t forgive other women being involved in the story. I begged and convinced her for a second chance. She said she would try.

She blocked me on all platforms and said it might take even upto 2 years to forgive me. 

I am too much in love with her. From her smile to her eyes. There’s something special about her. We are so similar yet different. I love how she’s so weird. She bothers me all day and I loved it.

93,His Instagram activity is being harmful towards me and our relationship,"Okay, so, I’m in a LDR with this guy since July, and I have never had to deal with him looking at other chicks on Instagram, however, when I visited him for the first time, it all went well, there was sexual tension etc... you know.. everything was fine. But when I left he started following dozens of half naked Instagram models who do nothing but posting provocative pictures of themselves. Of course I was a little shaken, hurt and overall very angry, but I decided not to look crazy and psycho in his eyes, so I just let it die out. He kept following those chicks everyday for almost a month, until February, then he randomly unfollowed all of them. I thought “great, I didn’t even have to confront him about the situation”
It all went smoothly until he started doing it all over again, but worse. In one night he had followed 30 half naked (and sometimes naked) chicks and fitness influencers, including those profiles who post hundreds of random girls tagging them. 
I decided to talk to him about this matter because it was clearly bugging me, and I was planning on doing so when I’d visit him the second time, which was in mid February. But I had noticed a change in his behavior, he wasn’t really “touching” me unless I’d take his hand “there”, it was really weird because I could actually FEEL the se*ual tension between us, but now it was just... almost unexistent. He used to absolutely lust over my body, now he doesn’t even ask for “pictures” anymore.
I’m just putting it out here... I think I’m a fairly attractive girl with a very good looking body, so why does he feel the urge to look all of these girls up? 
Is he getting tired of me? Doesn’t he like my body anymore? Is he really choosing a bunch of random th*ts from Instagram instead of a REAL person with REAL feelings? 
But when I talk to him everything seems normal and he really loves me, but I just can’t get over the fact that he needs to look these girls up. Actually this makes me think that he’d have no trouble looking at other women in real life too, so I might get cheated on, who knows 🤷🏻‍♀️

So needless to say I've been pretty broken for 21 years. I don't remember most of my child hood up until about 14. Thats when I started drink in n getting high more so around 15 n 16 though. I stopped carring I basicly decided to commit suicide slowly by drinkin. I figured Hell I don't wanna live past 50 anyways. My parents try to care but they just ignore the problem most of the time I don't blame them though. Annnyways I met this girl who I think is the most amazing person in the world. She's had a hard up bringing too but she's so much stronger then me. When I'm around her I feel miles away from all my problems. For the first time ever I put someone before myself. I've always had friends but as much as I hate it I used them. I was either friends with them cause they could get alcohol or drugs. It's like for the first time I have a friend who I don't get anything from. I'm there for her instead of needing her for me. She makes me wanna do better and I can actually see a future with her. We're just really good friends but there's definitely a strong connection between us. She helps me see past today or yesterday. I don't think she even has any idea how important she is to me. I can love myself now cause ive felt love. It's more then a sexual attraction or even because how beautiful she is. It's like I always know the right things to say to her. I feel like I've known her my whole life but we've only known each other a couple years. I'm leaving texas tomorrow I wanna tell her how much she means to me before I leave but I feel like that wouldn't be fair to her.

I belong to you forever, Anna.  I’ll always be yours   You promised that we were forever but you threw me away when I needed you most. Wasn’t I always there for you?

Well, I can’t do this any longer. There is nothing of me left. So I pray as I did when my father died...praying for death but what I got was the miracle of your intense love that saved me then.  There is nothing to save me now.

105,A message I sent to my 3rd love,"""Hey, I hope all is well and you're having a good Friday. There's some things on my mind that I'd like to get out, in no way to pressure you but I guess to kind of get your thoughts.. my main priority, in terms of our friendship, is to be in good terms with you, as best as I possibly can and that's something I always keep in mind. I'm not texting you, for you to make decisions or make you feel negative in any way, but you're someone I think about everyday. When it comes to you, your happiness and well being is my main concern.
I'm no where near the same person I used to be before I met you. Getting to know you changed me for the better, you matured me in ways I never expected and I am without question, greatful. Initially, having a crush on you did motivate me to do things ive always wanted to do, basically to be my best self and I understand if you think that it shouldn't be that way, that I should want to do things for myself, but it just happened to be that way.
I know that love is a complicated thing to talk about, but ive been sorting my thoughts and without doubt,  I do love you. There's not a thought in my mind that I can hide from you.
anytime I hear your voice or see you, my heart races and i just feel really intimidated lol in a good way. There's no other person that I could reserve my heart for, but you. 
I've put thought into our differences, I understand that they'll be there, but it still doesn't stop me from having complete trust with you. Maybe you see me as a sinner, or im not exactly sure what you see me as but regardless of that, I truly do care about you. 
I will admit, i do fight the feeling to text you sometimes, I'm not trying to disrespect your space, I want you to feel happy and comfortable. It's just that ever since you moved, i rarely see you and don't talk to you as often. I guess at this point, I'm wondering if should expect to hear less and less from you, and I'm not saying this in a negative way, but just to be honest about my feelings and situation.""",love,1552080338,Le_hashbrowns,13,32,True,2019-03-08

107,I'm starting to like a girl who's 3 years younger than me,"Hello there guys. This is my first post on here. And I'm feeling kinda happy and sad at the same time today. I think I'm falling in love (kinda) for a 14 year old girl, and I'm 17. She is also my teacher's niece. So here's the story:

My school organised a trip to London. Lots of people went with me. But *that* girl wasn't even from my school and/or my grade. She is 14 years old and my teacher just asked if she could go in the trip nonetheless. So I first saw her at the airport, and I instantly thought she was beautiful. But not her body, boobs or ass, just her face made me melt. We didn't talk much for the whole trip (which lasted 5 days) and I regret that. She basically had 1 friend in our group of 40+ people. If I just talked more to her.... but hey I talked a little. We were at the entrance of London Dungeon and she and other girls wanted me and my colleague to protect them because they were scared. Just those little 20 mins that we got to talk made me melt. Her face.. her smile... her voice...

When we got back from London, my teacher was there at the airport to pick her up and I said to my teacher that I loved to meet her niece and that she was awesome. Yesterday, back to my home country, I sended to her some pics that I took of her with my photographic camera. All the pictures are group photos. She said thank you. Then I asked if she liked the trip and she replied ""yes I loved it!!"". Since then we haven't talked because I don't know how to talk with her, or girls in general.

Today I had classes with that teacher and she was talking to her niece on the phone! She asked her niece if she had anything to say to *me* but she had already hung up. I asked ""why would she have anything to say to me?"" And she replied ""Didn't you send her pictures?"". I don't think I understood that part but I got to know that she tells almost everything to her aunt, which I don't mind. I don't think she liked me that much but I liked her... Then my teacher said ""why would you say you loved her on the airport?"". My teacher also said she's very young for me, and that she only likes horses.

What can I do? I don't know how to talk to girls and not ones younger than me. I just know she loves horses and that she's very shy (like me).",love,1552082745,g0ncalox500,3,0,True,2019-03-08
108,I sent a picture of my OTP to my boyfriend,"I’ve been in a LDR with my bf since February 24th but loved him since December. We got together the day he announced me happily he left his ex. That same day he said he likes a girl that’s similar to me. I gave him some tips. Later on, a bit after a silence, I tell him “Can I be honest?”. He responded while I was asleep. When I woke up he agreed and I said “Well, I like you.”, he was surprised and said he felt this way for a month (I also told him I get that way for 2 months) and I suggested a relationship. He happily agreed.

We are very lovey-dovey. I generally am a serious and reserved girl but I’m super lovely with him. I love him so much and I am too scared it’s too soon to tell him. We sent each other texts of what we’d do if we were together physically, etc.

I also am a DGM fan (him too) and I ship Lavi with Lenalee so I sent him a picture of my favorite OTP of all time. Man, he’s just adorable.

109,Is she into me or not?,"So, here goes. 
We met during a raid in PokemonGo (yes people still play). I recognized her ingame name, because of a gym she controlled close to my work.
At the raid I told her and said it was I who kicked her out of it, and she was like ‘Oh it was you, I thought I recognized the name’.
So after the raid we both leave into the same direction. I asked to add her as a friend ingame (and with that you can send gifts) and she agrees.

Few weeks pass, and we keep sending gifts from the same gym (close to both our works) to eachother.

After we meet again at some raids, I start a conversation about how ‘original’ our gifts are. She says she specifically sends those gifts to challenge me take over the gym and we both laugh about it.

During lunch break, I saw the specific gym was taken over by her and sends me the same gift again. You should know that raids are organised through WhatsApp, so I had access to her number
I decide to text her about the originality and she say she sends the same because she couldn’t pass another gym called ‘rotten apple’ to send that gift.  
I was a little surprised, and texted back asking if I had such a bad name with her because of taking the gym down, and said I’d let her stay in the gym.

One time, she sends a gift from town where my parents live and where I go to in the weekends. I text her about that gift and playing in the same city. We talk about how I live there in weekends (and where I live in the week) and that she was visiting.

During lunch break, I see her taking the gym down again. I text her about it and tell her I would like to join her on her lunchbreak-walks. She texts me I’m always welcome. So few days later, we have a walk together for gyms in pokemon.

We talk about a lot of pokemon-stuff and have a fun time together, always stuff to talk about and no awkward silences. Seperating ways I told it was fun and she confirmed it. I text her again about the rain we both had to walk through and how wet we both were. We joke about it and she agrees to repeat it again.

Few days pass, I text her with question of a walk during lunch. She says she has a meeting but another day can work. 

An evening she texts me about reaching lvl 40 and new gyms in the area and she  joke about buying a house at a new gym.

Few days pass again and she texts me for a walking lunchbreak. We meet up and have a fun time again.
After that, i asked to add her on FB. She agrees to add eachother. 

I then text her about my HP-collection (we are both Potter-heads) and she responds that I raise in her esteem.

The next 3 weeks she is on vacation. She sends pokemon-gifts from all the places which is nice. One day, she spontaniously texts me about pokemon there and we have some texts back and forth. 

Then it’s her birthday and I text her and she thanks me for the wishes.

Again, after a few days she texts again out of nowhere and have small conversation.

When back from vacation and at work, she texts to have a lunchbreak walk. I had meeting, but said other days worked. She responds and also asked about a job-oppertunity we talked about earlier.

We meet again (symbolicaly at the specific gym) and talk about her vacation and other stuff. 

Now, we always have a fun time. And talking with her is really easy, we have a lot in common and shared interests.
She is a really fun, gorgeous and smart girl.
I feel like we get to know eachother each time a little more.
I’m starting to think about asking her on a date. 

What do think? Would she be open for it?

110,"""I lost you but not forgotten""","I met him 4 years ago. Met him at my workplace. I was a messed. Had family issues. He invited me over to his place. I lost my virginity to him. We slept 1 more time after that then we lost contact. I dont remember how we lost contact. I even forgot about him. 


Then, he found me. After 4 years. Claiming he ""lost but not forgotten"" me. He said he went back to my work looking for me but I left shortly after we stopped our connection. 

He invited me on a date. Try things out between us. Since we never really had a chance. I initially said yes but changed my mind as for me past is past. No need to bring it to my present.

Then he makes his argument about my way of thinking. I thought about it. Then, agreed to meet him. I won't deny that I was also horny that time. He knows about it that as much as possible I dont want to sleep with him yet but I will likely do. I cant keep my mouth shut. 

We slept together. He assured me it doesnt matter if I sleep with him first date or not. I can do whatever I want. Be real to him.

We saw each other couple more times. I always sleep at his place and he always cuddles with me. Then, I realized I'm starting to like him.

I talked to him about us. Well, I told him I was scared of him because he's good.. too good to be true. Then, we talked. 

Here is some of the excerpt of our convo:

He said he's not good but he was glad I feel that way towards him. Then,

Him: apparently im a fuccboi at least thats what women keep telling me

Me: Is that what you are or what people labelled you?

Him: i dont really do well with commitment i'll be honest. i have bad  history of that

Me: so you dont like commitment?

Him: Not really its too much weight at least rn but ur super chill thats why i havent freaked out i think but i dont want to hurt you at the same time 

blah blah then,

Him: I'm glad you feel that way. I like you too but I just dont want to break your heart if you develop feelings for me. I still want to habg out with you tho but I need to make sure you wont have expectations. Also I need a small break, like 2 weeks to deal with personal issue rn. If you are okay with that we can be good friends as long as emotionally you dont set up disappointment for yourself. You know what I mean?

Me: yeah no problem 

Then I asked him if he is still with his ex. Or anyone exclusively. He said no that they broke up but they talk from time to time.

I told him I would appreciate it if he tells me oncw they get back together or even sleep together since I dont want to cross that line AND we are sleeping with no protection. I know. Bad idea but we both clean tested and all. 

He responded with, ""we can be friends.i'll be honest then you can choose if you dont want to sleep with me"" 

He continued,

""i've had probs with her but she is still bit in my life  tbh but i dont want to lose you coz i havent figured it out yet so id like us to be friends if thats not awkward to you""

Me: So you still have feelings for her and still figuring things out with her but you like me as a friend

Him: I like you as a person



I decided to give him the space and time he is asking. I'm stupid I know. But, I'll take a risk even if I know my chances are not good. That he will ghost me. 100% chances he will definitely ghost me. 

At the end of the convo, he sent me heart emoji. I told him I will let him lead. Let him decide. I dont want to force myself to someone. If he ghosts me, then I move on. If he comes back in 2 weeks, decided that he will be with his ex then kudos to him. For the bravery. For keeping his word. If he comes back in 2 weeks and choose me, well.

112,Stalking,"Okay, I’m going to admit, I stalk my crush a bit. And by a bit I mean I know exactly where he is at all times (during school hours), in a pure, mean-well sort of fashion. Everyday it’s become routine for me to see him out of the school building before either a) taking the bus home or b) going out after him if I’m getting picked up that day. Yesterday I waited for him to pass me in a hallway, I followed up after him and near the exit of the school he looked up at a plaque on the wall, I walked a bit slower and as I was passing him, I saw his head was facing upwards where the plaque was, but we ended up making accidental eye contact (his head was facing up but his eyes weren’t where his head was facing), I may be jumping to conclusions but I’m thinking he knows I’m following him. He’s done this about 2 times before (slowing down, waiting for me to pass then going on). He’s also moved his seat at lunch to where he can read and also look up to face in my direction. Another thing is in school he’s an a honor roll, ap gt student who doesn’t interact with others much, he usually just stays in the same spot in class and doesn’t move around or y’all too much, when our seats in English changed, he sat backwards in his seat, he was facing me. In class we make eye contact but I don’t acknowledge it as I am probably imagining things.  Recently I get the feeling that he’s been seeing if I really am following him. We have a similar friend (my crush and I have only talked to each other in group discussions at school (debate)) and when I talk to him, I catch my crush in the corner of my eye, we make awkward eye contact daily and I’m starting to think this isn’t so one sided. Also, today I said to my friend, “look, a fight” because as I was waiting to be picked up I saw a fight happening, my crush turned around and looked around to see what was happening (we were about 5 ft apart).

The first one ended because of physical abuse after twenty years, the second happened after being single for thirteen years. It lasted twelve years. I am the one who initiated the divorces. In retrospect, the only commonality between the two was that I ended up not liking either of my husbands. I would like to have a loving relationship I've never had but so worried that I don't know how to know what to look for. How do I know I'm really in love?

I met her begging of freshman year, she sat right next to me and she said she knew me from middle school but i had no clue who she was. I ask her how she knew me and she said ""I know you from when I got placed in your class for a day, I tried talking to you but you ignored me"" I felt awful after hearing that. We talked a bit and she gave me her number that same week(I lost it the same day but got her snap) we talked for a while and I started to form a crush for her. I felt a really strong connection that I've never felt before with no other crush I've had before. She was different, she was amazing.

A maybe 2-3 months go by and our seats get separated and she starts talking to a new guy and he seems really nice and cool. We start to drift away not really talking anymore only to ask eachother if we had any work to do for that class, I knew I lost her then. I was heartbroken and depressed for a while then a month ago I finally got over her. I took a break for a while trying to find a girlfriend but out of nowhere last Friday I had a dream about this girl and I weak up the next morning to realize I still have a crush on her. I still feel the same way about her even though I tried to get over her. 

I go talk to my friends about it and they give me terrible advice, the closest I got was ""try talking to her"". I made some small talk today but it was nothing. I have no idea what to do, was she flirting with me when I first met her? Was she just being nice? I really have no idea because I know she is an extremely nice person with a great personality. I'm scared to ask her out because she talks to that guy I mentioned earlier daily. I fell like she likes him and I missed my chance already.

121,Love...?,"\*sigh\* I've been looking for an appropriate area to post my story since this all happened. Please don't make any comments about my feelings, this is will all link to an important question at the end of the post.

&amp;#x200B;

Nearing the end of 2017, my mother's aunt and uncle died. They had two cats that would have been put down if we didn't take them in. When I met them, there was just... SOMETHING about the younger one, Tiny. The other, ran away a few months after. Something about her was just... different. There was something telling me that she was special, but oh well. the years passed and everyone was happy! Then came, the day before Valentines Day, 2019. I was with my boyfriend and we were in my house watching anime and eating Subway sandwiches (so romantic right!?). All of a sudden at about 6pm, we heard this crash and dogs going insane by the side of our house. We ran outside to see two dogs huddled around one area and their owner laughing, I will never forget what happened that night...

FB= fucking bastard (dog owner)   Tiny= my cat   BF= boyfriend   me= this is the ultimate test to see how smart you are!!!

&amp;#x200B;

ME- what the fuck do you think you're doing

FB- doggo's found a snack in your front yard missy

FB looks up and realises theres two of us and one of him

BF- get the fuck away from our property

FB- BRUTUS! SNAG! C'MON BOYS!!!

FB smirks and says,- better say bye-bye to your pussy-cat

BF spots Tiny on the ground where the dogs were. I run down and she's panting, scared to death. We run to our bathroom and look at her wounds. Neither of us know what to do so we rush her to the vets clinic. They tell us that there's no chance she'll live, as she has a puncture in her side and her liverd was damaged. We took her home and brought her to my room, (the place she felt most comfortable). She started feeling hot, so we turned on the ac as she enjoyed the cool air. We both sat there, stroking her for 2 hours, she never looked away from me. I sat there, helpless to do anything for her. She passed away at 3pm, on Valentines Day. It all feels so wrong, so lonely. All of a sudden, only just today I realised. This isn't the feeling of loosing say, a pet (I've sadly experienced it many times). This is the feeling of loosing someone you fell in love with, but not the kind of love you have for... let's say a sibling. It's the feeling of loosing a wife, a husband, a bf, a gf, a whatever!!! I don't understand why I feel this way, or even if it's normal.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I want to ask my question, has anyone else ever felt this way towards a pet? oh, BTW, I'll pop in a link you can copy and paste so you can see a picture of her. It will be an oldie from Instagram.

122,You are,"You are my morning coffee
You are the laugh that makes me lose composure
You are a fast car and a straightaway 
You are my country road drive down a shaded, twisting path to nowhere in particular 
You are spring wildflowers and falling stars 
You are the cool side of my pillow
You are my beautiful starry night, moon rising
You are the smell of burgers grilling in summertime
You are the shocking jump into cool water 
You are the cold patch of clover when I'm running barefoot across hot, dry grass
You are sand between my toes 
You are the wave of the ocean that lifts me high and sends me tumbling backwards
You are the deep, earthy smell of summer rain
You are fireworks on the 4th of July
You are adventures, pirates, and never growing old
You are white roses and a picket fence. Lemomade stands, apple pie and meatloaf.

You are my sunset
You are the first chill of fall
Melted chocolate, toasted marshmallows 
You are the song that makes me cry
You are the 3rd paycheck in my 2 paycheck month 
You are a wisp of a zippo lighter 
You are a new box of crayons 
You are freshly sharpened pencils 
You are a sigh of relief after the hardest exam 
You are that funny smell the first time you turn on the heater after a long, hot summer
You are the brightest, fullest moon on the spookiest night
You are candle lit pumpkins
You are deep conversation about nothing consequential 

You are the warm glow of a bonfire on a cold night 
The soft glow of scented candles
Deep Red, my favorite color.
Passionate.
You are my hot bath after a long day
You are a warm towel fresh from the dryer 
You are slow kisses in a hot shower
You are twinkling Christmas lights
You are snowflakes on Christmas Eve
You are fresh sheets and fuzzy socks
You are sparklers and champagne new beginnings 
And a kiss of promise, for good luck

You are my shoulder of comfort and reassuring hug
You are the Cinderella ball I always dreamed I'd go to
You are fresh baked cookies and I Spy
Salt, cold, winter fog above a new shore. 
You are the big, beautiful, old home that inspires my creativity
You are hot and bothered, tangled sheets, heavy breathing and dim lights. Eyes rolling back, ecstasy. 
You are my schoolgirl crush and blushing fantasy
You are the day that I nailed it and accomplished everything
You are the thrill of flying 200 feet above the ocean
You are carnival lights 
You are Mardi Gras and beaded necklaces, buddah chimes and thunderstorms

You are early spring sunshine on my face
Parting clouds
Southern winds
You are the promise of what is to come 
You are my muse
You are home
You are everything I love

123,Dumped 💔,"I am dumped by my ex boyfriend after ive given all of me, invested my time and efforts, sacrificed so many things just to make him happy, and even avoided my friends just to be with him. Just because of ""small fight"" he broke up with me decided to leave me alone and after a day or 2-3days, his dating someone else whos a big opposite of me. Hes been my boyfriend, ""fiancé"", and my best bestfriend for 3yrs and 2mos before he dumped me. Now its been 6mos since he dumped me and i think ive moved on. but theres a time when our mutual friends open up about him and it just hurts me only a little bit unlike before, i cried in front of them bc of what they have told me (him and his new girl so happy together). I always wish that someday i can find someone better than him or maybe the best, whom i will treat as my best friend, will listen to my stories even if its boring, will accept me for who i am, and will help to heal the scars he left. Ive always wanted to have my ""ideal""  boy bestfriend whom i will treasure forever and whom i can make him happy and succeed in life. But i think it is already impossible to find someone like that bc of my appearance - i became ugly on the outside. Why? Bc i forgot to take care of myself and fix myself when i am too busy taking care of him just to be the luckiest man that everyone would see and meet. Honestly, a part of me still wants him back and the other part doesnt want him already in my life. 
I wish him and his new girlfriend all the best in life. I always keep on praying that i dont want to see or hear from him anymore bc it still hurts me everytime someone reminds me of him. ",love,1552121903,ayreeneruns,13,8,True,2019-03-09
124,The One That Got Away,"I first met her in first grade and had a major crush on her, she was the new student but ended up moving away at the end of the year.
I didn't see her again until 5th grade, by that time school was pretty much ruined for me i was bullied by everyone even teachers.
Me and her road the same bus and had the same pe so we started hanging out.
We eventually started to ""dated"", i use to sneak across the gym when we'd play hit the cones to spend time with her.
We got caught holding hands on the bus by the bus driver and she was the first girl i ever said i love you too.
She was the reason i went to school.
The bullying ended up getting so bad that my dad decided we should move and it was just a spur of the moment kind of thing.
So i never got to say goodbye to her, its been 8 years now.
I've still never gotten over her, I've had a few long term relationships then longest being 2 years.
But from time to time I'd have dreams about her nothing inappropriate just us hanging out.
I found her on Facebook a few days ago and sent her a friend request, she didn't know it was me because my Facebook is my first name.
But i sent her a message and told her who i was and asked if she remembered me.
She did and turns out she's never gotten over me.
And her ex's always hated how she'd say she'd find her bestfriend again and that'd he'd understand things about her or try understand them.
I figured after 8 years it'd be awkward talking to her but it was like i never left.
We've both told eachother we love eachother,
And flirt a lot.
She's just as beautiful as the day i left.
Turns out her birthday is a few days after mine so we have the same sign.
We have a lot of the same interests too which is pretty cool.
I'll see how it goes but I'm still gonna play it safe just in case because we've both got our futures to worry about she's joining the military in August and i just enrolled into trade school for welding",love,1552124633,ImMrNobot,2,2,True,2019-03-09

Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

129,"What makes someone love you, but not be “in love” with you?","What makes someone love you, but not be “in love” with you? I’m the perpetrator here and I can’t even answer that question. Ill be honest and say the I was with someone for 2.5 years and I felt doubt about our relationship at 6 months. and honestly for no reason at all, it was just a feeling. But I kept it going because I WANTED it to work with him. He was so great to me and he has everything I wanted in a man (responsible, loving, caring, loyal, etc). He was in love with me. &amp; I truly did care for him and love him, even still after I left him last year. 

But when I was in the relationship, this doubt took over my life and happiness. He is a really great guy. He treated me very well. We rarely fought. We were like close friends. But for me, something was “off.” I didn’t feel like he was “my person.” It sucked. I wanted it so badly, but the feeling of being “in love” never formed. I know what being “in love” feels like too...I’ve been “in love” before, in my past. 

I’m just wondering if anyone has done some soul searching and understands what made them feel that way (whether you felt it or your ex felt it). Or has any ideas.

Even though I wanted it to work with him so bad, I know both him and I didn’t deserve the confusion and doubt.

It's been a year since my breakup, i've never loved someone as much as i loved him. He was like a really jealous person and possessif but i still loved him. We broke up cause he couldn't handle the thought that i had exes.

But now i don't believe in love anymore i guess cause i don't want to feel what i felt when it ended. And it's not just love i even can't imagine me kissing anyone even though i know they're my type and all but it's like it's blocked.

I act weird and outgoing so that they like me and they are impressed by who I am. I mean I know when I meet someone and they are really outgoing I’m like wow they are cool so that’s what I do. I know it’s bad and I shouldn’t do that but it’s my way of feeling less of an outsider and like I still belong in the town I used to live in.ANYWAY. One of my friends came up to me (my only other real friend at the party that I still talk to) and told me a kid we used to go to school with now goes to school in the town I’m currently living and going to school in. Jessie and I (we will call him Jessie even though that’s not his name) haven’t talked in what feels like centuries. I haven’t made that many friends in my new town so she said that she’d tell him to meet up with me for lunch. Now I don’t know what happened guys... I’m not confident or the first one to make the move or anything. But something weird came over me. So my friend starts texting things like
 him hey do you remember Rebecca (me) .
 He says yes whatever. 
She then suggest getting lunch with me.... whatever, right? 
THEN I STEAL HER PHONE (I guess I wanted her to think I was some badass who doesn’t give a fuck and who’s just the coolest) AND I START TEXTING JESSIE THROUGH HER PHONE. 
I’m saying stuff like “hey let’s get lunch sometime ;)” (yes with the winkey face so gross)
“Oh you go to THS that’s where the cool people go” 
“Maybe u can invite your friends”
“Okay it’s set a place right on the water. It’s a date” (keep in mind he and I are so out of touch tf was I doing)
He plays along and I found it quite funny. In my head I was like haha I’m scaring this guy. I was actually gonna piss my pants it was so funny how stupid I was making myself seem. I really thought I was scaring this guy. He then tells me he actually can’t leave the premises of his school to go out and get lunch with me later on. 
I say 
“Are we breaking up” 
“It wasn’t meant to be”
He again just plays along laughs and just makes conversation and he adds
“This is better than doing my research paper”.
Anyway after being an annoying person to him I give up apologize for being such a shit head. NOW I DONT KNOW WHYYYYY but something came over me and I LEFT MY NUMBER FOR HIM IN CASE HE WANTED TO HAVE LUNCH WITH ME. (I didnt wanna have lunch w him okay).
Let me tell you I sent the text care free I didn’t really give a shit I thought it was the funniest thing. I thought he’d read it think I was a crazy girl who just really wants a guys attention and then ignore me. I didn’t actually want lunch w the guy (again this is all through my friends phone but he knows it’s me Rebecca).
He reads the text message I sent w my number. Leaves me on read.
And doesn’t text.
Perfect! I didn’t give a crap I did this whole texting a guy and asking him out thing as a way to get my friends to laugh. It was for the shits and giggles. I thought he knew that too!!!
But today....
I get a random ass text FROM JESSIE. He just says 
“Hey do you actually wanna get lunch sometime?”
I’m shook y’all. I just don’t even know what to do. I feel bad to say hell no but so awkward to say yes. Why would he even ask to have lunch with me??? I’m so confused. I’m pretty sure he’s just playing with me but why would he ask. HALP A GIRL OUT AND TELL ME WHAT U THINK!!!! Plz☹️",love,1552268861,smaghs,0,1,True,2019-03-10
173,Questions in a poem,"We knew each other for some time now, we grew to be friends, but like a tree through the winter my feelings hibernated, only to bloom in the spring. The tree is in full bloom, but is dying for water, as I have not felt the rains of passion fall on my leaves, but only a light shower. Should the clouds be holding more? Or will the clouds drift away, to water other lands. This is my conundrum. I have fallen for her, and she seems to enjoy my presence. But, even though this tree gives her shade, would it be worth it for her to cut it down? I offer her the fruit I bear and the shade I give, and all I ask for is some water. She could have left once but stayed near me. Is she here to water this poor tree, to cut it down, or is she unaware the tree needs to be cared for. The tree is unaware of what to do to keep rooted, and is hurting all the time.

174,Complicated Friend/Ex (Mature content),"Okay so me and this dude dated once for like a day. Then we remained best friends for a year and I asked him out and we dated for another week then I ended it with him because his ex who he was (is) crazy about texted him and he told me that if we broke up then he wanted us to still be best friends. I broke it off because I didn’t want to get my heart broken again. So I ended up dating his brother for like 3 days (he’s his fraternal twin brother, so same age and stuff) (I dated him because I was going to they’re house with a friend for a while after school and then my ex started being really mean and even slammed my finger in a door one day) so I turned to his brother for comfort, he asked me out and I accepted. I only broke up with him because his brother (my ex) started hating me and ignoring his brother and stuff and I didn’t want to start family shit. Everything was fine and dandy. I moved schools and eventually me and my ex started talking again and being friends. We were playing overwatch today after weeks of me begging him to play with me. We were on a call and he mentioned he fucked someone. I was shocked and ignored it until after I ended the call abruptly because I had to eat dinner. I texted him about it asking him to elaborate and he keeps avoiding the subject and ignoring me. We’re actually pretty young and I’m 96% sure that it was his first time and I have to say, I’m kind of upset. He also loves to bring up his crushes and how he’s liked most of them for over a year... (within the time we’ve dated). We continuously flirt but that’s it. I tell him about a guy I like at school and he always changes the subject. Right when I think I like him and he likes me, he starts describing a crush with such vague details that seriously apply to me. (He makes fun of for being short, he has certain classes with (the same ones I had with him before I moved schools), he’s known her for x amount of time, he recently just started talking to her again) and when I finally think that it’s me, he drops the name. It’s someone else. I have no idea if he’s doing this all on purpose to mess with me. It’s getting tiring for me to start liking him and stop liking him and my heart is just so confused. I have no idea what to do. He’s not awnsering my messages about him popping his cherry and I’m really upset. Advice? ",love,1552271215,anonymous131250,2,1,True,2019-03-10

It’s hard not to get lost.
 The way your hair gently rests over the left side of your face,
Next to impossible.
We got esperares from the group when enjoying each others company,
We were lost,
But we’re were lost together.
We found the group,
But then I truly felt lost,
Did you?
It didn’t take us 5 minutes until we looked at each other,
Our eyes met,
And they asked,
“Wanna get lost once more?”
Of course I wanted to be lost with you,
I already was.
Lost in the way our shoulders would touch slightly, and we would both lean in just a little more.
Lost in the way you would listen intently to every stupid word that came out of my mouth.
Lost in the way you always look like you’re trying not to laugh but suck at it.
Im lost in you and I don’t want to be found.

181,First,"What does being in love feels like?


I was never close to one and I have always imagined for it to be like walking in a field of roses, to have someone you feel like sharing your almost every waking hour with, someone who you feel excited to just tell them what went on in your entire day. Well at least, a simple good morning and good night.


But instead, the past few week has just been my phone no longer having that unique vibrating pattern that I put only for your messages. I see him coming online, viewing my social media updates but yet I have to keep initiating contact and as of yesterday my message goes unreplied unlike when we first met a month ago.


Hours and minutes goes by thinking if I did something to push him away. Was it really something I did or was I just one of his flings? Am I overthinking or should I just move on?

182,Among the Thorns,"A Sonnet

—

Among the thorns is where my love resides:

Her eyes, urbane, such as a Grecian urn.

My heart swells like the coming of the tides.

To weave my hands unto her own, I yearn.

—

Her heart gleams golden, Chrysomallus bright;

Arresting auburn eyes akin to oak.

The other roses left in summer’s spite;

My Evening Primrose blooms in autumn’s cloak.

—

Kallisti etched upon my longing lips;

To kiss her own embodies ecstasy. 

This love elixir, drained by many sips,

Has quenched my fiery heart tremendously.

—

All your amor assuages and adorns,

Your fount of affection among the thorns.

193,"First, are all relationships like this?","What does being in love feels like?



I was never close to one and I have always imagined for it to be like walking in a field of roses, to have someone you feel like sharing your almost every waking hour with, someone who you feel excited to just tell them what went on in your entire day. Well at least, someone to wish you a simple good morning and good night.



But instead, the past few days has just been my phone no longer having that unique vibrating pattern that I put only for your messages. I see him coming online, viewing my social media updates but yet I have to be the one who had to keep on initiating contact and as of yesterday my message is still going unreplied... unlike when we first met a month ago.



Hours and minutes goes by thinking if I did something to push him away. Was it really something I did or was I just one of his flings? Am I overthinking or should I wait because this is the norm or should I just move on?

194,I’m confused,"I’ve been in a relationship for over 2 years with a wonderful guy. We’ve been truly happy and I thought he was the one. But lately I’ve been feeling sad and empty for no reason and I get irritated with the things he does or doesn’t do sometimes. He is so loving but I feel that it is too much, I feel so bad because of it, I feel that I’m not appreciating him for all the love that he gives me and it makes me feel sick.
We have talked already and I told him all of this and he said that we can work it out and that he can change and control himself cause he can be a little too much sometimes. I really hope this feeling will go away because I love him, but I also feel bad cause he wants to change for me and I think that that’s not fair.

Do you guys have any advice? Have you been through something similar? ",love,1552309379,Cutebisscut,1,1,True,2019-03-11

I love you because I love you... 

and because I love you, I hate you! 

and from hating you, 

I love you more than my own life 


I love you because I love you, 

and because I love you, I hate you.! 

I hate you when you are morning sadness 

but I love you when you are night happiness 


I love you because I love you, 

and because I love you, I hate you! 

I hate you when you want to be what you are not

in the cold dawns, 

but I love you like you are 

in the hot nights of the cheerful summer. 


I love you because I love you, 

and because I hate you, I love you.! ! 

I love you because you have 

the mischievous boy's infinite happiness 

lost in the rain of the afternoon, 

but I hate you when the gloom floods you. 


I hate you because I love you, 

and because I love you, I hate you ! 

I love you because you have the sensibility 

and the fondness contained in a loving tear, 

but I hate you when you are a lot of hidden memories. 


I love you because I love you, 

and because I love you, I hate you ! 

I love you because you are divine engineering, 

but I hate you because I don't deserve you at the nightfall. 


I love you because I love you, 

and because I hate you, I love you! ! 

I love you because you are my life, 

but I hate you because you are my death 

and in the face of this great dilemma 

I will die hating you... 

to resuscitate loving you! !",love,1552309532,The_Jedi_UR_Looking4,0,3,True,2019-03-11
196,The real foundation for relationships: Respect,"My philosophy on a successful relationship is that respect is the real foundation to build love upon.

This foundation can prevent you from getting into a toxic relationship. We’ve all seen these relationships: They break up, trash each other on social media, and then get back together, repeatedly. They cheat on each other, or try to make each other jealous. Because they don’t respect each other they don’t know how to communicate. Oftentimes, they get into screaming matches in public. The whole relationship is a mess. Relationships should never be that stressful. (And no amount of makeup sex is worth this nonsense). 

Also, you need to respect yourself. If you love and respect yourself, you won’t put up with any of this nonsense. 

I hope this message can help prevent some potential toxic relationships. ",love,1552312394,TenDoll,1,9,True,2019-03-11
197,"Relationships are not that easy.

At the end of the date, he told he couldn’t move on from his traumatic experience with a psychotic girl. He told me he couldn’t start something new with someone he barely know.

Was really lost and dumbfounded and he is the only one I really showed my kiddy side (my vulnerable side) to. Had a few traumatic experiences as well but I really thought he’s the one. Ended up breaking my heart again.",love,1552317187,chillingbeer,0,1,True,2019-03-11

i normally think he does like me but he also hangs out a lot with a very beautiful girl who is also more interesting and intelligent than me. i am not jealous and i get along well with this girl but i am paranoid that everytime he says ""yes i like someone"" he means this girl and not me.

203,Girl Kept Flaking On Me; Did I handle it the Right Way?," 

I am a senior in high school, and this all happened very recently.

So I was texting this girl that I hit up on snapchat for about a month and a half. I did not know this girl IRL, I just had her on snapchat and thought she was cute so i hit her up and we started talking. We texted for about 2 weeks, and it was going very well with her responding in less than 5 minutes each time, and investing in the conversations. She would even randomly hit me up when i wasnt in contact with her and ask what I was up to, how my day was, etc. After those two weeks, I asked her out so we could meet in person and she said she would love to and agreed to go out with me the following friday. That week went by and I sent a confirmation text on tuesday to see if we were still on for friday. She said that she had movie night with her friends scheduled for that night that she had forgotten about, and friday wasnt going to work. My two cents told me that this was horse shit but I decided to use the ""three strikes(flakes/cancellations) and your out"" method. Strike 1. I suggested that we reschedule for thursday, and she said that would work. The next day on wednesday, I sent her a text with the goal of setting up a time for thursday, and she said that it wasnt going to work after all, but did not give me a direct reason. Strike 2. She immediately apologized and said she wanted to reschedule for the following friday of the coming week. I agreed and suggested we meet at 6 PM, and she agreed. I thought that this was a positive sign of interest, as we now had a set time that we agreed on. That week rolled by, and all seemed great until thursday, the day before we were supposed to go out, she texted me at 4 AM and said that she couldnt make it friday because she had plans to go bowling with her family that night. Strike 3. I immediately knew that this was bullshit, as who remembers family plans at four in the morning? Her three strikes were up, so I decided to draw the line and make my stance on the matter clear. I told her that if she wasnt going to respect my time, than I could'nt respect hers, and told her that if she really was interested in seeing me, than SHE can make plans with ME, and I wasnt going to attempt to schedule anything with her anymore. She then tried to justify her flaky and selfish actions by saying that her family comes first, and she will choose them over somebody she has never met before. This was all a giant red flag as it is, but the final nail in the coffin for me was later that friday night, the night were supposed to go out she posted a picture with herself and another guy at the movies. This proved that her reason to flake on me was a blatant bullshit lie, and I was done at that point. I called her out on her unethical actions and then cut contact.

I know that was long, but now my question is: Did I handle this situation correctly? Was there a better way I could've handled this ordeal in order to possibly salvage it or prevent what happened from happening so I can avoid this nonsense in the future? I know that I have already blown my chances with this chick and I'm moving on but I would like to use this as a learning experience for future encounters.

208,The millionth time I fell in love with my boyfriend,"The first time I fell in love with you was about 4 hours into our first date. There’s been nearly a million times since then, I’m sure, that I fell in love with you all over again. 

I still remember, so clearly, one of those times, about 6 months ago. I had just wrecked your car. Completely my fault, I got distracted. I called you at work and you immediately asked if I was ok. You, despite panic in your voice, calmed me down from hysterics. You left work immediately to come to me. You showed up minutes later, tears in your eyes. After we sorted everything out, you got me home and called work to say you wouldn’t be returning that day. I know how much it means for you to miss work. I wasn’t injured except for some bruises to my sternum, you just stayed to comfort me. 

I was in shock, sure, but mostly I was devastated about your car. It’s your first car. You purchased it with your own money and you were so stoked to have gotten it. You’d had it stolen not even a month prior and we’d just gotten it back. You’d had it for only a few months total. It’s an older car, and we both knew it was going to be difficult to fix. I felt so terrible. You told me you didn’t care, that it was a car and all you cared about was if I was ok. You never said a single word that made me think you cared about that car, even though I know you did. 

You cuddled me all day. You gave me a massage because my back was tense. You cooked me food and brought it to me in bed. You even plucked my eyebrows and brushed my hair. You got really high with me and watched funny movies. With tender kisses and a forgiving touch, you made me forget about the accident for a few brief, amazing moments. I fell in love with you so many times that day. 

Today, for the first time since that day, you handed me your keys and said that I could drive your car. Even with it still damaged from my accident, you trusted me behind the wheel again. 

And today, as I slid into the driver’s seat, I fell in love with you all over again. For the millionth time. ",love,1552336414,littygrittykitty,4,127,True,2019-03-11

212,"He called me his girlfriend, skeeeee!","This needs to be documented that the boy I'm totally falling deeply in love with called me his girlfriend yesterday, awww, swoon. 

&amp;#x200B;

He is so sweet, kind, thoughtful, cute, giving, appreciative, funny, silly, creative, adorable, a goof, total dork, sci-fi/fantasy nerd, good lover, ambitious, organized, awwww I just love this boy. 

&amp;#x200B;

He's not perfect, but neither am I. Something I've learned after leaving a nearly nine year relationship is that love and relationships is about finding someone you can imagine yourself with in the future. Someone you're willing to compromise with and make it work. It's about finding that person that makes you smile, that will fucking kiss you for no damn reason, or hold your hand. Lust fades, but knowing you've found someone to share your life with, that's what love is about.

&amp;#x200B;

My only hesitation is that both of us got out of long term (5 year +) relationships only this past fall. We are both still healing our hearts, but kinda stumbled into this romance. It started super casual...

&amp;#x200B;

We met on Bumble, both of us were just looking for a friendly hook-up, but over the months it's slowly been evolving into something more and more serious. Yes, this all sounds amazing, I know! I just worry (and as I'm typing this I know how dumb this sounds), I worry he's still not ready for a serious relationship and is diving into this relat with me to cure his heartbreak from his ex.

&amp;#x200B;

IDK maybe it is, maybe it isn't. I'm not sure, but I'm pretty damn sure we both want something serious. He's discussed us moving in together/living together and I would like that! I mean I do love my solo, running around naked life, but I would prefer having a partner in crime. Someone who always has my back and loves me. 

&amp;#x200B;

God, I'm sorry I'm just babbling, telling y'all whatever pops into my brain...

Really though what I'm trying to say is, I'm in love with this really amazing guy that I can NOT believe any one wouldn't want to date/marry/love me forever/can we have a Notebook romance? Swoon. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't stop thinking about him. And not in a lustful crazy way, just throughout the day, I'll think about him, and it makes me smile. \*Heavy dreamy sigh\*

&amp;#x200B;

I sound like a blurbing bonehead, I want to marry him, I want to be with him forever, and also I NEVER EVER considered having kiddos, but I could actually imagine that with him, which is nuts!!! 

&amp;#x200B;

God, what has happened to me? I'm open to folks' thoughts, questions, whateves on my disorganized post.

215,Why are women so content with being alone?,"I was dating this girl for a couple months and then she told me that she just didn't have time and that she'd rather be alone. I feel like women postpone the relationships until they can finish what they're doing but then they're in their mid-30s and they complain because they're single. Why do women do this? Isn't cohesion something that happens more frequently? There's any women out there who have a perspective on being single and inspiring to your goals without a man, do you think that you're happier?

Personally oh, the ability to have companionship, love, and a partner in crime that you can share your passions with and still have a successful life shouldn't be diminished. I'm tired of women saying that they don't have enough time in the day, if it's truly meant to be shouldn't they be more accepting to having another? It might sound selfish but I'm not the only person who feels this way.

221,In LOVE with Robert,"I have fantasies of us naked together and visions of him finding me on a Subway platform and kissing me. I am like a child. I do not feel that I am too young for him. Nor do I feel that he is too old. Nor do I seem to care that he is married. I will try to date other men again, though they will never compare to the way he made me feel. I don't know him, but something happened to me the day we made our formal greetings at his job. I tried calling him to tell him that a random effing chick thinks he is amazing, and could not reach him. I feel pathetic. It's been five years. I am attracted to other men but it's not as intense of a need. I feel like a vampire in love. I also feel like an angel. I have no control over what has happened to me. I must be out of my mind but I think he is the most handsome man I have ever met in my entire life. I don't know if it's fair to pray for this phase to go away. There are times when I catch myself wanting to die for a moment but I could never kill myself because I love myself and I love my family. When does just a crush turn out to be an obsessive reaction to someone's beauty and perfection? I want him to control me. 

Then there's a man named Dave. He on the other hand has never had children. I find myself wondering what my life would have been like had he decided to finally settle down and just meet me and get the whole wife and kids thing going. How do some men go about this, yet other don't? Are they being true when they marry a woman or do they do this as a correct way or proving that a societal construct is what is morally right? 

There is an energy that you, Robert, have when I think about you. Because we are from different cultures from the same continent there is a homeliness that it brings to my heart to know that someone can be so distant yet so close to home. I felt protected as I did when I was holding my father's hand as a four-year-old child about to cross the street in Jackson Heights, Queens. To know that there is a person out there who can make that feeling and memory come back to you as an adult is comforting and destructive. My heart is in so much pain and my mind is enduring so much confusion. I do not feel safe and I am accepting my ultimate outcomes in this world. I wish I had never run away from everything as I usually do but I also want to tell you everything I had ever known! I also tell people that this happened and each reaction is a negative one. Why? How can such a human emotion and display of sincerity be shunned to an extent of superfluous delusion on display? We must be living in some kind of separated barns. My longing for you is real. What I feel is what I have always known since our eyes locked; that love is a real, deluded series of innately truthful yet uncompromising heartache. I would run away with you and escape it all. I don't know if I would with anyone else. I don't know whether I am capable of being alone, though. And I don't know if you see me as a mere child. To be honest I don't know you at all. This crush has involved daily heart palpitations for the past five years and I think i am just going to find an easy solution to get away from the matter at hand in my life. I am just going to express my love onto other people. Because you wore a ring. Because you love someone else. Because even if it was mutual we never did anything about it. You must have had a lot of women of my kind. I'm just a peasant and you never loved me. Though here I am, pathetic and indeed, attached to a very special kind of ghost. 

I stare into the mirror and confuse myself. Maybe I should throw them all away? Though they're not mine, and I did not buy them and I am trapped in this categorization of concubine illusion. Would I want to be your concubine, your lowest-ranking mistress? No. I need to be beaten by you to a pulp in solitary confinement to feel that our love is precious and invinsible.

Maybe we need to be apart for now, but I have so much love for him all I want to do is give him space to grow the way he needs to.

I am still a little sensitive to everything considering my last relationship ended because it stopped feeling like romance I don’t really believe that I have felt this strong about someone before but it does come with a catch, I get into my own head whether or not I believe he loves me. he has said it once which shocked me, I have not said it...at least not yet. I’m finding myself almost on the verge of saying it but I feel that I am almost afraid to say it. He has repeatedly told me how much he likes me, and has said he loved me at least once. I don’t feel that he is lying, but I’m not sure why I’m afraid to say it back. He is truly wonderful and I know him and I are so easily connected, despite small differences but that’s life. 

I don’t want to compare our relationship to a previous, but there are significant differences in personality that make me think he might not fully be interested in me as he says.

228,I'm not so slowly falling for my nice friend and I'm very happy about that,"Now, I wouldn't say I'm getting bullied at school. Because I truly believe I'm not. For context, I go to a rather small school, meaning you have the same kids in about every class. Well, my class has had an on going inside joke for months where people just like to make fun of me. Quite honestly, I'm usually fine with it because it can be pretty funny and entertaining.

There's three people which I would call my best or very close friends. Let's call them X, Y, and Z. X has always been very keen on the 'making fun of me' trend. Actually, I think he was the one that started it. At first, I found it funny, but now, I notice more genuine hatred than friendly teasing. It used to upset me, because I've always considered him as very important to me, but now, I'm kinda used to it. And it's more annoying than hurtful. I mean, I can predict whenever he's gonna make a joke targeting me and what it's gonna be. Unfortunately, because of this, we have become a bit distanced. 

Y is my best, best friend. Most of the time, we both playfully tease each other. I could probably count on only one hand the times he might've crossed the line, but I've crossed the line with him a couple of times too. So I let em slide.

Now Z has **always** been playful. Sometimes he even goes out of his way to make his 'mean' jokes purposefully bad. For example, he often points to a trash can and goes ""Haha, that's (insert my name here)"" and I just laugh and call him stupid or something. But he also does small little things that show he cares. Like today, a couple of friends and I were over at his house when I rested my head on my hand with my eyes closed. He lightly flicked my face, which made me go ""Hey! I have a headache!"" I was expecting something along the lines of 'boo hoo' or 'suck it up,' but instead, he offered me some medicine. That just made me swoon. I know it might seem ridiculous or silly that I took that as overly nice, but compared to how anyone else would've reacted, it felt big to me. 

He's always been known to be a very happy guy. And before all of this, I never _really_ got to know him, so I always assumed he was a careless guy. But recently, he noticed I was looking sorta down and was quick to ask me what was wrong. Then, I guess to not let me see through his happy go lucky mien too much, he said ""If you don't tell me, I'll..."" At that point, his voice trailed off as he made a fake, almost cartoonish angry face.

As our friendship has started growing stronger, I've been able to see his sweet side, or I guess once could say cute side, a bit more. Like I always make fun of him by saying he barely has any muscles. One day, he had a short sleeve on and jokingly flexed (very quickly) just to make me shut up but immediately got really flustered and embarrassed, it just made me smile oogly. Comparing this goofy behavior to the macho, and not having a care in the world persona he puts up with just about everyone else makes me very happy. Even though he's called me ""one of the boys"" before (all of my close friends are boys after all), it's noticeable he acts differently around me. Or I don't know, maybe I'm leading myself on. Either way though, he makes me feel like I'm on cloud 9. :)) ",love,1552378398,woohooguaido,0,5,True,2019-03-12

234,When love and pride collides: defying fine line between LGBT and Christians,"LGBT Community, in contemporary world, is getting bigger. And in today's time, it is becoming a norm for people specially for teenagers. 

Last Sunday, we were invited to His Presence Church International(HPCI) to attend a Sunday mass. It is our pleasure to interview one of their members, Arlene. She's been a part of the church since 2015. 

Despite the issue between the church and the LGBT community, Arlene mentioned a few things to remember.

Listen. Hear their stories and reach out to them. Some of them might be confused at the moment but if guided correctly, some of them may go back to their original design.
Arlene shared stories about her co-members who actually went back to their original design and how grateful she was for that.

Acceptance. The most important thing to remember, Arlene emphasized, specially to people with relatives and friends from LGBT community. No matter what path they choose, as long as it does not harm anyone and it makes them happy. We have to learn how to accept them.

Do not tolerate. Do not tolerate the wrobg doings. People who are part of the LGBT Community must have respect on their own in order to gain respect. 

Pray. Nothing beats pray. Pray for these people, Arlene said, not only because of what the bible says, but because no matter how far we stray further from God, prayer leads us back home. His arms are wide enough to accept us. 

We ended the conversation by sharing our own experiences. How one of us coped up and went back to our original design after years of hiding it.

I even lied about my problems yet they still found them out. I don't want them to worry about me. Everyone is so nice to me. I don't deserve the kind of people in my life. Their kindness is wasted on a guy like me. I want to cry out loud but I physically can't. If I did that they will worry, I don't want that. I watch a lot of animes and in some there are characters who have lost their will to live and there is always someone who gives them the will to live. Who guides them out of their darkness. I want to find that person for me. The one who can be my light in the darkness of my heart. But what if she comes in my life, will I have the courage to tell her my problems. Will I have the courage to help her. Do I want the people around me not to worry about me or do I want her in my life. I can't decide. Everyday I so much time online. I don't want to think about my problems. They remind me of the people who are in stress just because there are helping me. I don't want to feel the sadness, the pain, the frustration.

242,Today was an interesting day.,"My man told me we needed to talk today, so we did. I was preparing for the worst, with every negative outcome flowing through my mind. But I breathed. And I relaxed. Once I saw him I felt comfortable and at home. I knew the talk was serious, but I still felt safe around him.

The talk comes and... it’s not as bad as I thought. In fact, it was good. He told me that he can’t live with himself knowing he has little time to see me. He hates having to cancel on me or not be available or be too tired from his demanding work and extracurriculars. He wants to feel back our expectations and put less pressure on having to hang so that when we do, he is 100% present and not tired/stresses from his work. He’s beyond busy, with little windows of free time that are never certain due to the nature of his work.

I’m leaving the country in three months as my time here was temporary to begin with. But he told me that he’d buy a plane ticket any time he can to come see me 3000 miles away.

I guess what today taught me is that some people are worth fighting for. With any other guy I’ve been with, I’d give up on them because I felt like it wasn’t worth it. But today, I realized that my man is worth it in every aspect. The care and maturity he showed me today is unmatched to anything I’ve felt before in prior relationships.

245,Help me,"The day I fear the most had come Yesterday at 10:59 pm my girlfriend Guadalupe had left me and I feel so lost without her. This is what she said.

These past few months have been the best with you. And I love being with you. But there is something missing. And, its me. I have had the greatest time with you. And I cherish any moment I have with you. But, there is something wrong with me personally. You know I have mental problems and physical problems. And that has effected me greatly. Although you have greatly took some of that pain, I still suffer. And I noticed that I love others more than I love myself. And I want to change that. But...by myself... I love you but I....I want to split. You have nothing to do with it. Its all me. And I have seen myself loving others and caring for others more than I have been loving and caring for myself. I need my own time alone to find who I am. And I know you love me as much as I love you. But, I really need help and time to find who I am. I need to love myself first in order love someone else. And I need that. I need my own time to do that. But..I want you in my life still. And I know it will take me a long time to do so. I have terrible problems with myself, and I'm tired of suffering. No, I am not going anywhere. But I just need time to find who I am because, to be honest, I'm lost. I dont know what to do, and I'm constantly asking myself if this is something right and if I'm doing the right thing for others.

Another text:

And, I'm tired of thinking of others before me. Dont get me wrong, I love helping others, but I want to help myself first before I can help others. And its something that constantly bothers me. And I want to fix that. It sound cheesy but, its not you at all. Its all me. And I want to love myself and become better than what I am currently. Mentally and physically.

And another:

I don't want you to leave my life. I want you to be a best friend. And help me keep going. Because its a mental thing that I need help with. I want you there to help me. And I thank you for your understanding. You are amazing, and I couldn't be more greatful for you. And just know that your understanding and help is the best. It lets me keep going. And I need that. There will be some days that I want help and many days that I don't. But don't leave my life because of this. You have impacted me, I need that in my life.

From me to give context:
If that's what you need then I'll be there for you.

From her:

That means a lot Dante. I'm really sorry if I hurt you, but it was my choice. You are an amazing person and you make me happy. Don't change who you are because of this. I want you to be you. And never, NEVER change because of me.

Me that night restless at 6 in the morning:

I'm sorry but I can't seem to get any sleep, I just can't believe that this is really the end, and it hurts much more than i could have ever expected. I honestly don't know if I'll be the same person, please understand that, I just need some time to become whole again. I really do care about your happiness more than anything Guadalupe so please I want you to do one thing for me, I want you to find what your looking for and if you ever come across someone better then me please love them and cherish with all your heart show them that talented and smart girl that I fell in love with, because I want you to be happy no matter how I feel.

255,The first of many days I fell in love with her.,"I (M18), have a wonderful, amazing woman in my life (F18).

It might sound insane that I'm in love so young, but I am. I firmly believe it. 

The first day, was a summer night, probably around July 7th or 8th of 2018, since we started dating on the 13th. I had known her for a month or so by then. She had started working at the same job I had two weeks after I was hired. It was a Kroger, I was a bagger, she was a cashier. We made small talk, and at the time, I was awkward, but had begun developing feelings for her. Little did I know, she felt the same. 

That night, I had begun having real, personal conversations with her. We started talking about our issues, and I brought up how alone I felt. I stayed with her until midnight, when she got off work. We stayed in my car, a 2005 Chevy Cobalt, until 2:30 in the morning. All we did was laugh, sing, and bond with each other. That was the first time I felt true love, that was the night we confessed our feelings for each other.

The second, was the first time we kissed. I was scared to kiss her at first, me being a very awkward, and shy guy. We, were in my car, again, it was one of the spots we just sat and talked late at night. She kept saying things about kissing me a few days prior, but didn't want to rush it. By that time, I was ready. It's hard for me to remember who initiated it, but I just remember feeling the most relaxed, confident, and most importantly... loved, than I had ever felt before. 

Here's to a future with this girl. She probably wont see this, but I hope she does, because she knows this story probably better than i do. I have a bad memory.

And if she does see this:

1 year later i moved back down again. I still had her on my mind, and deep rooted feelings for her. 

But i started dating another girl. This was a childhood friend of mine. It was certanly not a good idea. Cause it was the hardest and most challenging part of my life. Not gonna go to deep into it, but there was a lot of emotional abuse/manipulation and an overall bad relationship.

I guess this is part of the reason i can't get over this other girl, to this day. Because she is the last reminder i have of an good relationship. So i guess it makes sense in that way?  It just drives me crazy, cause it has been 7 years. And she is in a domestic relationship.

Feel like i can't intrude in her life, but at the same time i feel the need to spill my heart out to her( I did do it one time drunk AF, NOT a good idea, there was no response). But i'm afraid she is gonna look at me like a creepy asshole. The dude that couldn't get over her in 7 years... 

So i guess i'm out for advise. What would be right to do in a situation like this?",love,1552497788,C-Tvera,1,2,True,2019-03-13
265,You saved me.,"I spent 5 years with a guy who was manipulative, abusive, narcissistic, and just such an awful person. We had a daughter together. He cheated on me. Threatened me. Tried to kill himself in front of me multiple times. My walls are covered in holes from where he hit them. 

But I finally got out. It took so much longer than it should have, and because we have a child together, I'll never be rid of him completely. But I got out of that horrible relationship. 

You saved me.

You came into my life just when I needed you. You have helped fix everything that he broke. You make me feel beautiful every day. You make me feel loved and wanted and cherished and needed. You tell me all the time that I'm the best thing to ever happen to you and that I am perfect. Even with all of my issues, my struggles with my mental health and self esteem, my reactions to certain situations because of my past traumas...you help me through all of it without judgment. I feel so safe with you. 

I never knew love like this was possible. Healthy relationships are such a foreign concept to me but every day you remind me that I deserve the world and you do your very best to give that to me. 

Thank you for saving me. Thank you for loving me. Thank you for making me love life again. Thank you for being the one that didn't give up. Thank you for being so good to me and my daughter. We are so lucky to have you. I am so in love with you and all that you are and every day with you is better than the last. 

I cannot wait to spend forever with the man of my dreams. To watch us grow our family. To look back on our lives in 50 years and know that we did this right. You are always my forever. I love you.

Months had passed, and we just stopped talking for no reason. He became a completely different person and started drinking, partying, just became rude, and flirting with all kinds of girls. It absolutely broke my heart to see him become someone that I had never known him to be. He later started dating a girl we go to school with, but they broke up after a short amount of time. Well, time has passed since then. Now, we talk quite a bit (not like we used to, though). He walks me to classes we have near each other, walks me out of school, speaks to me in the hallway. I took him off of my Snapchat after we stopped speaking because I felt it was just hurting me to keep holding onto him, but just a few days ago he brought up that I had took him off of Snapchat (something I did long ago) and he took my phone and added himself back again. He gets so jealous when other guys flirt with me, and he makes mean jokes about them. He even kept a note I wrote him 6 months ago. Any time I’ve kinda dated a guy and he’s heard about it, he’s urged my friends to tell me no to. He’s being so nice to me now. It’s almost like it used to be. I’m just so confused because he’s a flirtier guy than what I was used to him being.  I just need someone to tell me what’s going on. Ugh we were talking a day or two ago about how we used to act around each other and one of his friends even said we acted like such a couple.

I bonded with each of them one on one and long story short, I ended up catching feelings for them both at separate times and the feeling was mutual for them too. Essentially it became a love triangle, but things didn't get messy until I fell in love with Russ last fall, we connected on a level I didn't even realize was possible.

The whole story is long and very complicated but it all comes down to the this: I had to choose between the *possibility* of reconnecting with the man I'm in love with.... or keeping James in my life, who is probably the closest friend I have and with whom romantic feelings are still shared.  I concluded that what I had with Russ was worth any sacrifice I had to make, no matter how small the chance of getting it back, but it's going to be so hard and I'm afraid of losing them both forever...

279,Heartbroken. On Valentines Day,"Very long text up ahead

So there was this girl that I’ve known since like 7th grade, we were really close friends, also our families were friends and we always had plans together, like any family friends do. The year I met her, my family, her family, and my best friends family went on a skiing/snowboarding trip and since I’m a skater I figured snowboarding would come easy to me. And as it was all of our first time participating in a snow sport we were all pretty trash. But it’s been 5 years since then and I’m proud to say I’m a much better snowboarder lol. Anyways that trip really sparked our friendship and we were close but not really close, not anything like best friends close but we were friends. Anyways as we got older I started generating feelings for her, especially Junior year, as any normal high school guy would with a beautiful angel of a girl (IMO, and she still is) so I decided I wanted to do something special for V-Day, I had 40dollars give or take to spend and I asked around for her favorite gifts, and got all of it, chocolate basically. I even wrote this note (I was madly in love like I couldn’t describe it, I was not able to focus on school or anything else since the start of junior year, even thought my grades suffered I did not care. Just seeing her everyday brightened up my day) : 
I always tried to find the meaning of real affection, not some fake ass relationship where I just go for someone for clout and that’s it. I wanted to find someone I could talk to about my life, my struggles, my successes, everything, and anything. I wanted to be able to have fun doing the stupidest shit, have fun just talking. Someone that reflected the same type of humor that I had. I wanted the type of affection you only find in a romantic movie. You can call me unrealistic but that was my dream. And when I thought I found a great person, it didn’t work out, just a couple months of fake affection, I guess. Coming into junior year I found the actual perfect person. They are beautiful as hell, so beautiful, you could not compare them to anything, it wouldn’t be a justified comparison.   She is so pure, she has no imperfections. They are smart, in their own way. No one can know everything, but the stuff that she knew, she knew well. She is extremely creative. She would be able to draw the most amazing, intricate stuff on a piece of scrap paper and say it was just a scribble while they were bored in class. Most important of all, this person had the best personality, I could not stress how much she brought out the best in everyone, you could never be mad at her, and frankly, there was no reason to ever be mad at her in the first place. You could easily vibe with her, I was never nervous around her. I can remember every time I was around her, talking to her, I would always feel so much better, even if I was having the worst day, she would be able to brighten up everything, it is like magic. And last, but not least, she had the best sense of humor, and would do the stupidest stuff and still be happy, the type of humor that I like and the same type of humor I have. She would randomly say something and burst out laughing, her laugh is the best. And her jokes were even better. (Girl’s name), you are the real reason I believe in angels, you were sent straight from God to make the world a better place. 

Anyways. I had written this note a week before and I asked my friends if I should give it to her and all of them said that it was really freaking good and it brought tears to some of their eyes. Either way, I gave it to her and I jeard from her friends that she geared up and said that she didn’t know I could write something like that and she knew it came straight from my heart. But she also said that she wished someone who she actually liked would’ve written that for her. She also texted me “your letter was beautiful and very sweet and i can tell you poured your heart into that but i dont want to give you false hope or play with your feelings so im letting you know its not gonna happen”. And that, that broke me. I fell into depression, hard. I shut myself from the outside world for a couple weeks. Didn’t talk to anyone. Cried at night, in the shower, basically anytime that she crossed my mind. Some of you guys may not understand but she was the most amazing person ever. I don’t know if I will find someone like her again. Later on I realized that while I was talking to her, my closest friend was hitting her up at the same time (he knew I had hella feelings for her) and now they’re together. That hurt me even more. I’ve never been the same since February has ended. She’s tried initiating conversations again but Idk what to do it’s not like I can just forget that day. Even my parents have sensed something has gone wrong. And I cannot tell them no matter what cause of my religion and hers, we are not allowed to date.

280,How i met my husband.,"
So I first met my husband in highschool, but I didn't meet him the conventional ""boy meets girl"" way. We first met when we were 13 and he is 4 months older than me.

The first year of high school we were having a rally and I met a girl which we will call Lacy. Lacy was super upset telling me she just broke up with a guy who didn't get her anything, couldn't hang out and cheated on her. I though ""wow this guy is a sick"" and she later pointed him out in a crowd.

He was easy to point out cause he was 6' 2"" with shaved sides and a mohawk. He wore all black including a black leather jacket and backpack. He may have looked like this but some of the stuff Lacy said made no sense, so I did the sensible thing and talked to him.

Well first I talked with his friends then him. It was during lunch and he was sitting with two other people, one who was talking about anime, which I am a huge fan of (I'm not watching how I got reincarnated as a slime and it's awesome) and we were having fun.

When He actually talked he was really nice, not ""nice guys"" nice but real nice. We will call him Jay.

During most of freshman year I was harassed by guys saying I've never been with a guy/dated and I got sick of it. After 2 weeks of knowing Jay I asked him if he would be my fake boyfriend.

Yes a fake one; he said yes though. So we did couple stuff like holding hands and for some reason he took me out on a real date. Lunch at a nice restaurant and movie of Deathly Hallows part 2.

A couple weeks after the date and it was Halloween, by this point I really liked how kind and respectful Jay was being so I was understanding of him also.

On Halloween is when I actually confessed but also told him how I knew about him. We agreed to start dating and he told me all about Lacy.

She was a manipulative B**ch; she didn't want Jay to hang out with friends and lied about him cheating on her when SHE was cheating on HIM.

After that conversation Jay explained that because of his family he wasn't able to go out and do things, and how he got her a bunch of jewelry and stuff animals.

I also found out she is extremely gullible; I was able to convince her I was a spy from Durango, Mexico where my dad is. It was crazy, she also believes Jay is a ninja. Like what?

It's been almost 8 years since we met and he was my one and only boyfriend who got all of my firsts including marriage. We now have our own apartment with a cute tan guinea pig named Sammy (you can check out his pic on my page).

TLDR: how my fake boyfriend at age 13 became my real boyfriend who is now my husband at age 21 and it's all because of his ex.",love,1552540397,whateverisstupid,1,5,True,2019-03-14

283,over 5 years and i don't know what to think,"I've had a crush on a teacher for a little over 5 years and I don't know if this is love. I thought he was handsome from the first class freshman year but it took about four months for me to start having feelings (his age around 28-31). The personality and the way he spoke did a lot to draw me in. I never put him on a pedestal or thought he was perfect; he could be a jerk from what I heard. I always wanted to hold a friendly conversation (we had common interests) but wasn't able to because I was too scared. I figured it was infatuation. 

The year after me and a small group of students chose to go to an event outside of school and he was the one in charge to take us. It was the first time I was around him in the real world being more like a ""normal"" person. It was a great trip but the moment I left him to go home I felt this weird sadness came on and stayed for the following two days. I even cried once. I thought it had something to do with seeing him that way on the trip. I realized that I actually didn't know him at all and I would never get that chance. Another year our class did a volunteer park cleanup where the two of us worked side by side on the same thing for about ten minutes. That made me feel so warm and happy that I wanted to spend the whole day cleaning the park with him, even if it meant doing the grossest jobs! For the rest of high school I got used to how I felt; racing heart/clammy hands around him only sometimes. Any time I dreamed of him we'd be talking and laughing. I had him every year. I thought that when I stopped seeing him when school ended that the crush would have to go away. That it would get rid of all traces of those feelings.

But since graduating when things reminds me of him I feel this warm fondness that I can't say matches what I've ever felt for anyone else. I wonder how he's doing and sometimes when I'm at the store the braver part of me wishes he'd be there so we could talk for a while (even though I'd expect to be terrified). I wonder if he thinks about what I'm up to now. I'm at university, had crush on a boy which lasted about 3 months, and kept finding myself comparing the boy to him. He's been in my dreams and the next morning I don't understand why because I hadn't thought of him in months. And then I have phases when I think of him a handful of times each day for a week or two. I don't know what being in love means so I think it would be incorrect for me to say I love him but ""crush"" feels too weak and kinda superficial at this point. I just wish I had a name for this.

284,I would like to share a practice with you guys called loving-kindness,"This is a meditation practice that lasts around ten minutes and will be helpful to those who want to love a little more and be a little kinder to those who we interact with in our day-to-day lives:

Step 1: Find a comfortable seat, either on a chair, cushion or on your bed will do just fine :)

Step 2: Close your eyes and try to keep quite a straight posture. 

Step 3: Become aware of your sensory experience. This could be the feeling of your body against the surface you’re sitting on, feelings of hot or cold in your body, the rising and falling of your chest as you breathe etc.

Step 4: Now bring a loved one to mind, someone with whom you have an uncomplicated relationship with. (This could be a partner, child, parent or close friend.) As you keep this person in mind, think about how much you want this person to be happy, how you want them to be free from suffering, how you want all their dreams to be fulfilled. Continue to think thoughts of this nature. Do this for about 3-4 minutes. If you get distracted return your attention to the breath and then continue your loving thoughts for the person you have chosen.

Step 5: Now think of a person with which you hardly know at all. (This could be a person you see sometimes in a shop, a stranger you at times see as you commute to work) Now think these same thoughts about this person. Think about how you want this person to truly be happy, to be free from suffering, and how you want their dreams, whatever they may be, to all be fulfilled. Continue thoughts of this nature. Do this for another 3-4 minutes. If you get distracted return your attention to the breath and then continue your loving thoughts for the person you have chosen.

Step 6: Spend the final minute of your session thinking similar thoughts for yourself. 

Step 7: Finish your session or continue if you’d like :)

I just wanna say that I love everyone hear and I feel grateful to have the opportunity to share this piece of information that is so valuable to me with all of you. 

Remember that no matter how important it is to love and be kind to all of those we interact with, we should never forget to love ourselves.

If you have any questions feel free to contact me :)

286,I found the one,"It’s 4am, I’m lying here beside the love of my life listening to him breathe slowly, asleep, tracing my nails up and down his back. All I feel is love and gratitude flowing through me. I’ve never been happier than I am right now in my entire life. Just a few months ago, this beautiful boy was merely my best friend. 

All I knew before him is emotional and physical abuse, manipulation and a heavy feeling that I would never be good enough for anybody. I endured years of being sick to my stomach daily, depressed and full of stress. I only nearly escaped, bruised and emotionally battered. Now I can’t help but tear up when I think about how utterly good my boyfriend is to me and my daughter. I find myself wondering somehow if I deserve him. 

I’ve never known sex to feel like love until now. I’ve never been held so tightly and cared about so deeply. I wake up to a “good morning, pumpkin” and I fall asleep to an “I love you, baby girl”. Every waking minute that passes I feel how much he loves me and I’m so in awe of how the “honeymoon phase” just doesn’t seem to end. 

Tonight as he laid on my chest, I ran my fingers through his hair and we listened to all the cute and overly cheesy songs we could find saved on my Spotify while he told me how lucky he is to have us and how he’s 100% sure he’s going to put a ring on it because “why wouldn’t I?” 

If we’re home together for the day, there aren’t 5 minutes that pass where we aren’t touching in some way. I hear “I love you” 20 times a day. We cook together, clean together, we agree on everything from TV shows to music to our outlooks on life. He helps me with my daughter more than I could ever possibly ask for. 

This devilishly handsome man is the one I’m going to marry. He’s the one I’m going to spend my life with. He’s the one I’m going to finish creating a family with. He’s THE ONE. When you know, you know. And I just know. &lt;3",love,1552558861,aliakim,15,163,True,2019-03-14

I've been single for 2 and a half years now and now I've fallen in love again. I met this guy like half a year ago and weve been texting a lot, then met up a lot and last week, he finally kissed me and it was the sewwtest moment of my life because he told me he was so happy to know that I liked him back and he was smiling like a little kid. Ever since that day I feel like I've taken extasy or something I'm so happy.
But last time I got out of the relationship I was down for a really long time and I kind of still loved my ex for too long after the breakup. I'm completely over my ex now, but I'm still afraid if changing while in a relationship. Last time I was very jealous and very insecure and thought my then bf was to good for me and when he left me, it confirmed that for me. I don't feel insecure with the new guy and I know he's a good dude, but I'm still afraid. ",love,1552608276,francarabbit,0,2,True,2019-03-14

298,What happened with him or me?,"I met this guy on tinder back in December, things were well, off and on. I found out a little bit about him, he smokes weed daily, blacked out drunk every weekend, &amp; his friends aren’t the greatest (depression plays a roll). I have always had a feeling he may be depressed but he hasn’t really came to me and said he is. 

In February, he went on a business trip we didn’t talk for 6 days. He came back to me when he came back to our state, he kind of explained kind of didn’t in a way. We aren’t dating btw. 

Last week, I told him I was coming home for spring break (we are in college &amp; are an hour away from each other but our hometown is the same), he told me he was going away for the entire week, well, he lied to me. So now we haven’t spoken for almost a week &amp; I never confronted him. But it’s just confusing &amp; it’s upsetting me, especially since he was always the one to offer to hang out/meet up. He flirts a lot, he replies quick, &amp; he always starts the conversation with me. From the very start he did say “I’m not looking for a relationship at the moment I just don’t think I could handle one” but he knew that I was looking for a relationship, so I just don’t get it. He also would say things like “never thought you’d be interested in me” etc, so what gives here? I don’t understand. Was I the issue? Is it me? Am I just not good enough? Why would he keep talking to me for 3 months nearly ? Was he interested? What do you guys think, I need advice. 

Edit: he’s said before “I never thought you’d be interested in me”, we are not dating we haven’t met anyways. But it just is confusing and upsets me.

302,Love at first sight...,"Im an eighth grader who is a first chair flutist. For the past few months until last Sunday (day of the concert), the band has been practicing a few songs that will be played in a concert. The concert will involve 3 other lutheran schools (not a competition), and we (including those other schools) will unite as one and play the exact pieces we’ve been practicing. Two days before the concert, the other schools met at our school to rehearse and get used to how it will be like when we are united. The band teacher that conducted and taught us and the other schools assigned each student/individual to their seats. I looked around who i was sitting by. Because another school had another eighth grade first chair flutist, we had to share first chair (without actually using one chair obviously). That girl that i had to share first chair with was so STUNNING. Shoulder length blonde hair, soft-spoken, and quiet just like me. She even managed to start some nice conversations between us. On the day of the concert, of course everyone had to wear something nice or an aloha shirt. When i saw her again, her looks and my affection for her went from 9/10 to 20/10. This is because of her nerdy ray-ban glasses she actually uses on a daily basis, her dress, and her undone hair. This time we sparked even more conversations between us. She even started asking questions abt me and told me wut songs she sang when the choir was singing. Then, she talked abt her favorite parts of the music and which pieces were her favorite to rehearse and play, and judged how the flutist, that was accompanied with the piano for choir, was playing. I asked her if this was her last year. She replied, “yea, this is my last year and then im off to high school. I wouldnt have to wear the same weird uniform my school requires anymore after.” I said, “Oh, ok.” I asked her wut school she applied to. She replied with “I didnt apply to any school because im not going to private school anymore! Yaaayy!!” She laughed very hard in a quiet manner and i was laughing too while face palming. I promised myself to play and practice a hard flute piece that i started practicing WAYYY BEFORE all of this happened. I even told myself to practice it during regular band classes, the rehearsal, and the concert without making sound. The girl saw me pull out the piece and place it on the music stand we were sharing (this was when the choir was singing and the band was taking a break/intermission. The choir was on risers that was placed in front of the entire band section and the audience really coyldnt see us at all). While i was quietly practicing, she had a surprised and impressed look on her face and was like “my gosh this is hard. Why and how is he playing this?!” This is a story of me having love at first sight to another blonde girl flutist from another school. ",love,1552637073,mr_nicorasu,0,1,True,2019-03-15

304,I’m 16 and just fell in love at first sight,"Prom is right around the corner and I have this group of friends that I just sort of fell into when i came to the high school this year. I love the guys but early on i’ve been very skeptical of many of the women. two of them have been “kicked out” of the friend group for completely petty reasons and i’ve had major crushes on two of them, one early on because she had beautiful eyes, and the other happened yesterday. We can call her H. It made sense. Her friends were friends with my friends. Even though I hadn’t really talked to her all that much, I understood that she was gorgeous and that was that. I was getting really excited because i’ve never been to a prom before and just the thought of going, even if i was simply supposed to “take pictures and that’s it” excited me. That night, as i was talking to my sister who i am very close with, she just out of the blue suggested that i listen to 80s Comedown Machine by the Strokes on repeat to “let my soul rest.” And I said okay. I am probably never going to be able to explain to anyone besides her what I felt that night, but i didn’t get any sleep, and got out of bed an hour earlier than usual. I assumed that i would be tired, because the majority of the night was spent simply trying to go to sleep. I sang and danced naked in front of the mirror to my favorite song (the whole thing) after stepping out of the shower. I felt so good. In fact, I played “best day of my life” and “I feel good” in the car on the way to school. my plan was to ask her over snapchat, because that’s what all these people in the group said, but i wanted to at least snap her in the class i had with her. I was going to start off by just saying “hey h_____” and wait for her reply. and then ask her. i felt good. she looked at her phone. she didn’t respond. I excepted to be sad but i wasn’t. I was late to math because i couldn’t find the door. I was late to gym because i had to get a new locker combination. Then, in comes purple girl. She’s purple. and we’re doing fitness testing. and everyone around us is comparing. and we are both in outer space. she mentioned the fact that The Como Zoo could host a wedding. I said that a penguin could be the ring bearer. I was wearing my lucky underwear with penguins all over it that i didn’t think was lucky until about 7:30 that morning. They are my favorite animal.

309,Did he ever love me or did I just get played,"So I had started talking to this guy about five months ago, that liked me back in high school . Im now 20 and he's 21. It started out as texting and then we started hanging out. At first I had made it clear that I only wanted to be friends, but then eventually things escalated to the point where we were making out, so I called it all off in order to make sure that nothing went further than I was comfortable with at the moment, as things were moving very quickly and every conversation usually turned sexual. He texted me two weeks later and says he just misses talking to me so we started talking again. Before long I am going to see him again until eventually he told me that he loved me and that we should move in together as soon as he started his new job. He was telling me that he had never met anyone like me and that I had a heart of gold and a lot of things that seemed really sincere. eventually I was sending nudes and we were sexting and we were even making plans financially and he seemed super sincere until eventually I lost my virginity to him and two days later he texts me and says I'm too nice for him and that he doesn't love me anymore. He told me we should both be single and that he was distracting me from nursing school. He also told me that he was a bad guy and that i could do better. Did he ever love me or did I just get played?

Then I describe the positive effects love has on our mental health and then, when the deck crumbles, the negative effects it has on our mental health. Fyi this is NOT me fishing for a date.

319,Needing some help seriously,"Well this is going to be a large post.
My story starts like this:
I start talking to a girl a year ago. She is a friend of a school friend, we start chatting but like friends, we talked all the days and all was fine. One day just stop talking for a while (like a month).
All was fine until one day se text me again and again we star talking every day. But one day in a party, a her friend (also mine) says to me that she likes me. I was shocked, it came from no where. So I said to her if we can meet in her house, she agreed. We talk a lot about stupid things untill I said if it was true she feel something for me. It was true she was feeling something for me. With all been said. I explained to her that I feel something for her but I don't wanted to say anything because my friend was kinda in love with her in the past.
That was no problem to her. She explained to me that she wasn't looking for nothing serious (in the past her ex boyfriend was a toxic person and hurt her a Lot psychologically) I agree and said that we could try and seems what happens. I'm like more than a friend but no her boyfriend.
But now in the present, we have been in this kind of ""relationship"" for 4 months. And actually there are a Lot of problems in her family so she have a lot of things in her mind.
And in the last talk we had she said that she wasn't sure now of the likes me like a friend or something more like that, she dont know what she wants. So maybe our relationship will end and that is hurting me a lot.

I don't know what to do, I was thinking in give us a time so she can clear her mind and be sure about what she wants. Because I'm not feeling well, I'm sad and don't know what to do. I dont want to our relationship end i'm feeling like I felt in love but not sure to call it in that way

Forget to say that, when she told me, she wasn't looking nothing serious, I said that I was going serious with her. She agreed and we start ""dating""

Just needed to say it, and now i wanted no know what should I do. Thanks for reading. Looking forward for some advices.
Thanks again

321,Girlfriend is unhappy constantly,"I m not sure if this is the right place to ask my question. I wouldn’t be surprised if there is a sub completely dedicated to these types of questions but anyways, here it goes....

Sooooo i have been dating this girl for almost three years now. Since 6 months into our relationship she told me was unhappy but that it wasn’t me and then she proceeded to tell me what she wanted out of the relationship. She said she wanted to get married and I told her that I would consider that once we had been dating a little longer. Every 6 months since then she brings up the feeling that she’s unhappy and that it’s us a little bit and other things in her general life. She then tells me that she’s not happy with our relationship because she doesn’t know where it’s headed. I told her that I want to marry her but again once we had been dating a while. After that she stopped talking about getting married but the I’m unhappy conversation kept happening say every 4 months. I’m not an unhappy person. Our relationship seems like it’s great to me but apparently she’s unhappy. Every time this happens it makes me feel like shit. Like what am I doing wrong? Am I the one making her unhappy? Should I be responsible for her happiness? Is my job to make her happy? It literally is taking a toll on me. This morning she randomly texts me and says “I’m having a hard time. I’m so on edge and irritable.” I told her I was sorry to hear that and if I could help. She was grateful but vague. Then I ask, “is it work?” And she says, “yeah work and just in general.”

322,she taught me to love myself,"A girl that I’ve been crushing on and have had some semi romantic moments with is easily the best person I’ve met in my life. I’ve fallen in love before, but she’s so different. She’s taught me that love isn’t just one person giving their all to another person, it’s teaching each other to value themselves and aspiring to see each other do better. I spent a lot of time doing the opposite, always giving my all for her without really helping myself. She taught me that when you’re in love with somebody you have to take care of yourself, not pour your happiness into your partner, but spread the love you have in your heart and then get theirs back. This last week and a half I’ve been practicing so many self care routines, really making sure I’m happy with who I am and accepting myself first and foremost. And I honestly wouldn’t have even been able to do this without her. She taught me that life is too short not to value who you are as a person, and she’s been willing to wait for me to better myself before we try and become more intimate again. I can’t thank her enough for how much she’s helped me as a person, and how she’s taken the time to help me realize that I deserve to be happy. I love her so much.

Decided to try something else

Made a tinder account(and stoically never downloaded the app)

Mutuality? I guess

Things just might be different than they've been. I just might be different. She is different. She makes the cutest little noises when I rub her back.. X-files and ice cream and her cats.

I miss her sometimes, when I haven't met her for a day or two, and then I go to her and it's like no time passed. It's almost too easy and that makes me scared... But I'm not really scared.

326,Why is falling in love after divorce so scary? (27F),"Long story short, I divorced my husband after 2 years because I realized I was not madly in love with him, had never truly been in love and thought that I owed it to myself and my future family to be in a true loving relationship.

I've been seeing someone that is undeniably a match made in heaven. We are so creepily similar. We cannot take our eyes off of each other when we are together. We laugh so so much together, we run around and get into all sorts of shenanigans. I feel like a kid again when I am with him.

He has expressed to me how much he cares about me, how much he loves spending time with me. He brought a bottle of whiskey (my fav) over on international women's day and told me that he wanted to celebrate me for being such a strong and amazing woman. 

I think he is exceptional. The way he chooses to live his life, treats everyone with so much respect. He follows his passions with his whole heart... It all just draws me towards him like a magnet. He is purely the most lovely man I've ever known. He doesn't need to change a thing. I could watch him forever and never get bored. 

So why can't I express this to him? He tried to start the conversation a few times and I just told him to chill, I say we need to give it time. I think I am afraid of us falling for each other only to realize it's just lust or infatuation. So many concerns going through my head. Is this normal or am I jaded? 

He said he has also never been madly in love. I'm afraid all of his emotions are just lust. What do I do? Should I just go for it, tell him, and take the risk of heartbreak? This is rough.

It's different with her. There's chemistry between us, it's almost palpable. We can talk for hours about anything and everything, share stories, listen, and laugh. Every joke I make cracks her up, and she can coax a smile out of me with the simplest of jokes. We take an interest in each other's interests, we see eye to eye on many things, and we can sit in each other's company for hours without an awkward silence.

She's special, different, and amazing. This time I'm in it for the long run. I want this to last, but I'm not going to push it. We'll follow the flow of life and see where it takes us.

334,Why does she come back,"Okay like 2 and a half years ago I started dm'ing a random girl on insagram. With no reason really I just thought she was really pretty. Like really really beautiful. Her account was a private account but I started dming her anyway. I like told her I thought she was pretty and would like to follow her and told her if she likes this joke she should let me follow her. Anyway she did not like it and blocked me. After that I felt a little guilty. So I told my mom and showed her like that girls picture. It turns out my mom knew who that was. Her parents and my parents where like friends when we where very young. So that was super awkward. I was 16 at the time.

Anyway last summer I had another account but like not a personal account. I started texting her again. And in the beginning it was anonymous. She had no idea who I was. But we started texting for a little while. And a few weeks later I told her who I am. Btw I live now in a country in Europe but I am originally from another country. Her family moved back to that country when she was little. Her dad did that because he got 3 daughters and he is overprotective so he went back.He is kind of conservative.

I told her a couple of times that I think she is pretty. And she ones told me that she thinks that her dad doesn't know what is best for them and that he is very traditional. Anyway every year in january or february they come here as a vacation. So there was this like party my aunt gave. And invited them. So that girl her mom, little brother and little sister came.There was a moment where I shook her hand and my mom kind of introduced us.This was a party at like my aunt' their house they have 2 girls and 2 guys.And we are like very good friends I like hanging out with them especially with the oldest son.Most people at the party were like a lot of mothers who brought their children.I am 18 and one of the oldest that girl is 19 btw. But most of the like children where girls at the party.So it can be a little awkward in some cultures.What annoyed me a little is that she acted like she doesn't know me.Or maybe she really did not remember me idk. That annoyed me I wanted it to be a little awkwarod.

 Anyway last night I dreamed about her.And it was kind of intense in the sense that I really believed it was real.I was gonna marry her.And that is weird because I haven't been thinking about her much after that party and I have been really buisy.The dream was weird there was supposed to be a wedding but like everything was late and I saw her for a little moment.Her parents I don't remember what they looked like im the dream but it wasn't the same.And it was just weird.

338,Love at first sight,"I always envisioned myself as a hopeless romantic searching for love but I was at a point in my life where that picturesque idea of happiness was slowly fading away. Not in a 'state of depression' mind you, but rather just a gradual realisation (or so I thought) of the fact that something like that would always be out of reach. It was a sort of apathetic acceptance of loneliness. I thought I was rational and grounded in logic when I dismissed the notion of true love as this unattainable fairytale spun up in fables to give the masses a hopeful future to strive for; something to keep you going and give value to life where there may not be for some. I was ready to dismiss fate, destiny, the butterfly effect and any other concept of the lack of control we have as humans over the circumstances that shape our life. I was ready to dismiss all of this until I met \*A\*. She was a friend of a friend out with us one night and it took her 5 minutes to steal my heart. Excuse every cliche I'm going to use but if you've ever experienced this, then you know that they all truly make sense. It was like a flush of vibrant colour rushed into every aspect of my life. It was like the Sun's rays warming my skin on an otherwise chilly day. It was an electrifying feeling of two people who are destined to be in each other's lives meeting for the first time and both coming to the realisation of the magnitude of the situation. I wasn't sure what the feeling was at first but when the night was over and I was lying on the bed with her in my arms I just knew I was the luckiest, happiest man alive. I wish that night lasted forever and I wish I fully realised what was happening. I was still fighting it because it was such an outlandish concept that i couldn't help but be sceptical but below the surface- I knew. It's been about a month and a half now and she lives far away but we've talked every night for hours on end and she has me hanging on the end of every word she says. I'm so hopelessly in love with this girl and I know that we should end up together. The universe is screaming at us and I know that in time, what is meant to be, will be. Without going into specifics- timing is everything here. I have to get this right and I'm constantly racking my brain wondering if I'm doing it right because ultimately it's hard for me to relinquish control to the universe and by extension, leave my beating heart in the palm of her hand. I'm so thrilled for whatever comes next and excited to see what the future holds. The moral of this messily written tale I'm composing at 2AM is that it really is possible. For anyone doubting the notion that the universe has a plan and that what you're TRULY destined to have will just happen to stroll into your life whether you like it or not and regardless of how hard you force it (or avoid it). Good luck to all my fellow romantics, your time will come &lt;3.

One of my friends thinks that sexual desire is as important as consistency .
For him he can't be in a relationship with a girl can't give him the pleasure he needs. He thinks that chemistry is important too; and love is based on consistency and sexual desire .

351,Meeting by complete fate,"Good evening r/love. Thought i would share a currently developing story of how I met the person I am currently seeing as it was a complete coincidence.

So on the 20th of last month, i flew down to miami to visit my uncle for a vacation and to fix his car since I am a home mechanic. I replaced the ignition and the AC cooling fan but the AC still wasn't blowing cold, I was scheduled to leave on thr 6th to go back to my hometown in illinois, closest airport being o'hare, but i wanted to stay a bit longer and fix the AC in my uncle's personal car. However the next monday my uncle who is a limousine cheauffeur, had to take a job in fort myers, aka across the state, from monday to wednesday.

so i booked a flight from fort myers to ohare on tuesday, i end up getting the AC fixed, we take a limo road trip to fort myers on monday morning, and he drops me off at the airport, and i see this beautiful girl come onto the plane and sit on the aisle seat sit across the aisle from me, let's call her G. I was in the middle seat, and G's mom sits next to me. I occasionally look over at G because i think i recognize her but I wasn't sure. As we land, I sigh and say I cant wait to get back to (CITY). G's mom starts a conversation with me, and her and she introduces me to G, and as we are joking along the way to get our bags (about 10 minutes) turns out not only did G and I come from the same city about an hour and a half outside of Chicago, but we graduated from the same high school at the same time.

All three of us grab our bags and G and her mom offer me a ride home. I oblige as they both seemed pretty cool and I vaguely knew G from high school, and we were cracking jokes and having fun all the way back to (CITY). I end up getting her phone number.

To clarify, we met on a flight that i was not supposed to originally be on, almost a week after when I was planning on leaving, leaving from an airport halfway across the state from where I was visiting that I was only at because of a limousine call for my uncle, and happened to be sitting next to them on this flight from a seat that was randomly assigned (I didnt choose my seat this was on a budget airline and choosing your seat costed extra)

We ended up going on a date last thursday, she lives a mile and a half from where I do. And we formally saw each other over a thousand miles away. The date went remarkably well, she ended up under my arm while we were watching friends. I'll tell you what.

Or do you prefer the sort of love where you plan your life together,you go to say ikea together,renovate your house,talk about everyday things,spend a lot of couch time,no drama,are like best friends and very secure and safe? More like a sitcom than a film.

With my beloved it’s both,but the crazy passion has subsumed itself somewhat,I think a lot more cosy thoughts now,than wild moments.Hes not a wild bohemian/free spirit like me either so I sometimes miss a more wild ride.",love,1552801458,Katietennyson,0,2,True,2019-03-17
355,how i realized that im crushing on her,"well, this is my first time posting here. hello to u dear readers ❤️  (am i right? or wrong? nvm i just want to share some things up)

im moonstar. nice to meet you.

so basically im gay, gay girl, girl who likes girls, girl who watches gay shits floating around the net, 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈 — me.

i have a crush...all of us has a crush right? anyways, let's call her crystal, because she's a gem 😩 she's perfectly imperfect if im gonna describe her the easiest way. but she can do anything (i think??) she can do sports (basketball, volleyball, badminton, soccer, etc. you name it), she can sing too...and dance! she also can draw, and make poems about everything. she's a genius, she's a honor student btw. 

but she's imperfect in the way she's insecured about herself...she feel pressured because her parents is pressuring her. she can't do the things she wants because she's tied up. butttt, i like her. 

we're friends though, but im scared. im scared of rejection because i know to myself that she would pick school and family first before love. here is the thing, i was brokenhearted 2 months ago, and she was there, comforting me and making me feel better because even I, myself, is thinking that I'm worthless that's why she left (the one that im dating last year; my almost).

and that time, i realized that i have this feelings about her. im confused at first because we're friends right? but i just let my feelings flow down my system and here i am right now....secretly crushing on my friend that i know i can't have. maybe in parallel universe, in time, we're the one.

(I've moved on though if you're gonna ask about the girl that I dated last year lol)

I just want people out there to know that there can be light and life, love and happiness. This stuff actually exists! Life is worth living and experiencing, and without the dark I don't know what this light would look like to me now. But such has been the shape of my existence, and I wouldn't change it for anything now. 

If there's anyone out there who truly feels that they're at their wits' end, I just want you to know that (even though I don't know you, haven't met you, and am unlikely to ever meet you) I love you. If I had your experiences or you had mine, we'd be pretty much the same. Your life *is* worth living.

369,I can't stop thinking about this guy I only saw once. I have never felt like this before. Why? And why do gys stare but don't approach you?,"Sorry for bad grammar.. English is not my first language! 

&amp;#x200B;

The weirdest thing happened to me almost two weeks ago. I was at the airport because I was traveling alone to another country for the weekend to meet family. As I walked towards the line to board the plane most people had already boarded and it was short. I saw this guy from behind in front of me in the line and I thought to myself ""wow wow....."". Usually when I see good looking strangers and make eye contact with them I am like ""yeah cute"" and then forget about them. Now I saw this guy from BEHIND and I already felt super curious about him and found that very odd. The line moved and he faced me. I have never seen anyone this handsome my whole 25 years old life and I have never felt so attracted to a stranger/anyone before. I quickly looked down, but I realised he was starring at me so I looked back up. We made eye contact but he didn't look away he was just starring at me with a ""serious face"" straight into my eyes. If this was anyone else I would hate it and found it very creepy. I looked away but I could tell he was still staring.. After a while the line moved so I was behind him now. He turned around and looked at me for about two second.. My heart went crazy. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I approached the plane I noticed where he was sitting and that I had to walk pass him to get to my seat. As I came close he turned his face and looked at me and I looked at him and I smiled. I don't know if he smiled back because he was having a conversation with the person next to him or if he smiled to me. But it was a really big smile and the way he turned to look me into the eyes made me melt to be honest.

&amp;#x200B;

During the flight the shortest way to the bathroom was passing him but for some reason I just walked the long way to the back instead. I'm usually very confident but he made me so nervous. I saw him again at the airport when after we left the plane. I was walking towards the bathroom and he was coming back from the bathroom. He was with one of the people he travelled with, but I realised he noticed me and starred at me again until we passed each other. This time I was just looking down on my phone acting like I didn't see him because this guy made me feel nervous.. 

&amp;#x200B;

I passed him again where he collected his suitcase, I realised he noticed me and looked.

&amp;#x200B;

I only had a carry-on so I walked to the exit. I was standing there waiting for my family (+ kinda hoping I would see him again too) and thats when he walked towards me... Starring again. He kept the eye contact the whole time.. He even turned his head and starred while he walked out the door at the airport. With such a serious look on his face.. ? I smiled to him. Then he was gone I was hoping he would come back and ask for my contacts so bad but he didn't. I never saw him again, but I can't get him out of my mind. I have a really hard time getting attracted to people but I was so attracted to this man it was insane. At the same time I was frustrated that he starred so much but never approached me and that I will never know if he was interested in me or if he just starred for other reasons. I can't concentrate about anything because I am thinking about him all the time. I have felt ridiculous this past week, I felt that we had this crazy connection. Can someone please help me make sense of the situation?

Thank you in advance!!",love,1552829230,anonymouslyy44,0,1,True,2019-03-17
370,Completely indulged in infatuation for this wonderful person i met,"So I’m a 22 year old nursing student from Rhode Island who just went on spring break to Punta Cana. While down there, a beautiful woman ends up getting locked out of her room at the same time my friends and I are just standing outside of ours. She asks to come in and hang out, and of course that’s no problem. Her and I make some eye contact, and we both felt the interest in each other. I signal my friends to leave and we hang out alone with each other and the rest could probably be figured out by all of you. 
The next day we wake up again in Punta and spend the whole day together, getting to know each other, drinking by the beach, laughing, and thoroughly enjoying each other. It was the most romantic, best day of my life. We hang out on the beach at night and listen to the music that we both love. 
She leaves punta a day before me, and I’m immediately heart broken. My stomach is a complete knot, I can’t eat. She texts me after she gets home and says how she watched a Star is born on the plane and it made her think of me and cry. That text warmed my heart like nothing else. She says she wants to keep in touch because I make her smile so much. So we’ve been texting, talking about potential plans to maybe visit each other. 
Two problems: she’s a 30 year old nurse, so we’re 8 years apart. Second problem; she’s from Illinois, and I’m finishing my degree in RI. I am going through the WORST post vacation depression since getting back to school. I just can’t fathom how fast time flies and how I didn’t savor our time together even more. I worry that I’ll never see her again. We’re at two totally different stages of life. No, she’s never beeen married and has no kids, but that’s where she’s at in life, and I’m just about to graduate college. I don’t know how to control my emotions. They’re affecting my sleep, appetite, mood, motivation, everything. Anyone else ever experience these feelings of falling for someone on a short vacation, and it not being a very realistic possibility back home??",love,1552833293,christian9865,1,9,True,2019-03-17
371,Forever Isn't Long Enough,"This is perhaps a little unconventional for such a momentous occasion, but then again, so are we. In that sense, I’d say it’s perfectly fitting. 

I hope that as you’re scrolling Reddit later today and visiting subs, that you’ll stumble across this it and know it’s for you.

Wow, babe. Today marks 20 years since we first said I love you to one another -a day we consider only slightly more important than our wedding day in November because it’s the day we became a “we”.  Two decades have have passed since March 17, 1999, but I still remember the details of that evening. It shouldn’t have been possible at all and, yet, there we were. Unbeknownst to each of us, we’d each written a letter confessing our feelings to one another. I can still remember the fear I had in thinking that I was about to share something with you that you didn’t return/reciprocate. But, to my surprise, you did. I know you were surprised, too. We both read in silence and then looked up at each other completely dumbfounded that we’d each felt the same that whole time, but hadn’t known or shared any clues with one another. We sat on my couch in utter disbelief, closely tethered to confusion and fear as we knew what this meant: a helluva lot of complication was about to come our way. I was still married after all. Granted, it was the tale-end of a short marriage that was ending, but still. I know we each carried such shame in that fact and our absolutely shit timing. God, we were so young and so stupid and we moved entirely way too fast. Love doesn’t give a shit, though. Not young love. Stupid love. And goddamn did I love you. A month later we were engaged. Looking back, it was absolute INSANITY. If our kids now were in the situation we’d put ourselves in back then, I know we’d be doing everything we could to steer them in a different direction, but you and I? We steered each other. 

A mere 6 weeks or so after we’d finally confessed our love to/for one another I flew back to the United States while you remained in Italy. We would spend the next 6 months half a world apart. Ooo boy, and this was pre-smart phones, pre-facetime or skype. So we emailed. We wrote letters. We wrote in journals (that we’d later exchange). And damn did we have some hefty phone bills. One month it was over $500. Do you remember that? What idiots we were. Young, madly in love, and desperate to stay connected. From an emotional standpoint, we went through so much during those 6 months: so many fears that we couldn’t possibly survive 6 months apart. The insecurities and jealousies. All the uncertainties and unknowns. The first fights. Me being a single mom and trying to make my life work without stability. It wasn’t easy. I don’t know many 21 and 24-year-olds that would have stayed in the situation we put ourselves in especially because I had a young child from another man and you owed me nothing. You, especially being younger, could have said, “fuck this. I don’t need this complicated shit” at any moment. You didn’t. Not once. 

Six months later we stood in front of the justice of the peace at a courthouse in Houston saying our vows in front of our disbelieving parents and my young daughter, who was now your young daughter, too. I wouldn’t change those nuptials for anything in the world. It was perfect. 

Then, as quickly as we started, things quickly started falling apart. Surprise, surprise. It seems that rushing into a relationship, getting engaged a month later, spending 6 months half a world apart, and then quickly marrying and thinking we’d settle into our new lives together easy-peasy was a bit presumptuous. It’s really hard to look back on those early years because I know it brings up so many unpleasant memories. I know you feel such shame for who you were back then. I wasn’t perfect, either. We jumped into marriage each having heaps of emotional baggage, a young child, and a soon-to-be new infant son. In short, we were emotional wrecks on our own. Together, we were damn near volatile.  Yet, we pushed on. There were days I know we both didn’t think we’d make it. So many divorce talks. So many tears. So much fighting. Resentment. Add to all that the complications of military life, moves, two small children, and living paycheck-to-paycheck. It’s a wonder we survived at all. 

But love? Love sees you through. I know you always say that I’m the reason we survived any of it. I tolerated shit I shouldn’t have. I forgave time and time again. And I never gave up trying even though, god, there were days I wanted to. And you’re right, hon. I did work my ass off and I did put up with shit I shouldn’t have and we both know that had my personal situation been different (had I had my degree or a job or means to take care of myself and two children) our story might have ended before its prime -not because the love wasn’t there, but because it was so much work. That’s a fucking hard thing to admit, especially now. But it was our truth and we can’t deny that. I kind of think those early years of hardships are a large part of what has made us such a remarkable couple. So strong, so honest, so committed. We struggled and kept forging on even though we didn’t have to. Yes, I did so much for us. But, hon? You did the work, too. You always listened. You always owned up. You always tried. Even if your personal demons meant you tried only for a day or two before life clouded you and you went back to old ways, you’d try. I always saw that in you. Again and again you tried to be a better husband, better father, better friend. You struggled so much and I know there were days you wanted to quit, too. But you didn’t. So don’t sell yourself short, babe. Maybe I did carry an unfair share of the relationship burden, but that’s only because you hadn’t woken up, yet. You hadn’t come to see your demons. I saw them. Always. But I also saw YOU. The beautiful, caring, gorgeous man who would do anything for me and our kids. I saw a man working so hard. I saw the sadness in your eyes when you knew you’d fucked up. I saw the regret. And I always knew you were sincere when you apologized for your words. That’s the man I fell deeply in love with and that’s the man I knew was underneath all the other things that overshadowed you -things I knew that were out of your control until you recognized them. That’s why I couldn’t give up. That’s why I tried.  

Point is, love, you are not without consideration when it comes to our success. You did the work, too.  I look at you now: so self-aware, so kind, so patient, so loving, and so attentive. Sometimes I think you’re still trying to make up for the former-you, for all the years you couldn’t offer your best because it was buried; but, honey, you don’t have to. I love you fully and completely and wholly as you are. I sincerely forgive you for those early years when you weren’t your best. Throughout all of it, I never doubted your love or commitment to me and our children, not once. That’s an amazing thing. 

So. Here we are 20 years later. Maybe we both never thought we’d be here, but we are better than fucking ever. The fact that we’ve weathered some deeply agonizing storms along the way are are still standing so strong? Still so in love, still snuggling, and loving, and laughing, and sharing, and growing. And goddamn that sex. Baaaabe! Everything about who we are as individuals and as a couple is absolutely incredible. This vanilla life we’ve created? It’s absolute perfection. I’m so incredibly proud of us. I look into your eyes and feel home. Safe. Loved. Cared for. Valued. Respected. I hope you see the same when you look into my eyes. I honest-to-god never would have believed I could feel so happy. My troubled past and all that emotional garbage from childhood abuse, my not-so-good choices in relationships, our early struggles, the horrific things we’ve been through as a family. I thought I was doomed to simply accept and make the best out of whatever I was lucky enough to get, but no. This is THE BEST of it. You are the best of it. 

I know it has always bothered you that I don’t believe in soul mates, especially since you do.  I simply can’t believe that on this whole magnificent planet of billions of souls that there’s only one single human for each of us. What a horribly sad and lonely thing to believe. However, the fact that I don’t believe in soul mates doesn’t mean I don’t believe in you or in us. Oh, hon, if you could only peer inside my soul when it’s set afire by your love, by a touch, by a laugh, by a shared smile, or kind gesture. I don’t have to believe in soul mates to know with every fiber of my being that we found each other in this crazy wide world, under pretty crazy circumstances, because we needed each other. 

I still vividly remember the day a few months after we were married when you first said to me in our kitchen, “I’ll love you forever. Wait. Forever isn’t love enough.” That was such a pivotal moment in my life. The importance of those words might be lost on others or seem trite and overly romantic, but those four words are deeply ingrained into my heart and soul. F.I.L.E. It’s engraved on our wedding bands. Those words, or at least the acronym, have been written on every single card, every single love letter in the 20 years since. Oh, and the file folder tattoo behind my ear with all its hidden meanings for me and you. It’s kind of a magical thing because, for us, it’s been proven authentic -made more so by the fact that, holy shit, we literally keep getting better every single year. 

Happy 20th anniversary, hon. You and our children are my everything. The world around us could collapse in a fiery heap (I mean, looking around, it kinda seems so), but as long as I’m with you, I’m genuinely and wholly okay. You give me such credit for making you the man you are today, but babe, you have absolutely helped me heal my own demons. You have provided something no one else in my life has ever provided: unconditional love &amp; support. I know I’m not always easy. I’m emotional and carry so much damage from my past, even after all these years. Yet, you’re always there to pick up my shattered pieces and put me back together again. I probably don’t say it enough, but thank you from the bottom of my heart. I smile as I’m reminded that we do this for each other at all times. Maybe one of us carries more than the other, but always, at the end of the day, we nestle into relationship homeostasis, balancing each other out in all the right ways. I’m beyond grateful for you. For the work you’ve done on yourself. For us. For all that we’ve done to build this life we have together. 

I hope you’ve stumbled upon this letter and are filled with all the warm fuzzies. Admittedly, I kinda hope you’re on the shitter right now just for the added humor. That’s so us. At all times.

375,Sad. Sorry.,"This happened a few years ago with a girl I was practically best friends with and that I was in love with. We hung out every single day and the fact she lived just a two minute walk from my house was a dream come true. She betrayed me. She found out I liked her from a friend and our relationship was never the same after that. She quietly let me know that she just wanted to be friends and while I was crushed, I was overjoyed that she wanted to keep our friendship strong. Just as I was starting to get over it (barley) she started sending me random texts during some of our conversations that were either rude or down right hurtful before saying that her “boyfriend” stole her phone and that it wasn’t her. She never had a boyfriend and it was her the whole time. I sent her a picture of a page on my journal (boys get to have journals) where not only I detailed just how much I loved her, but also had printed screenshots of the awful things she had said to me. I hate to admit, I was getting a little desperate. She showed the pictures to her other guy friends but conveniently not her female friends (I am not trying to insinuate that girls are more emotional than boys but I think we can all admit that guys don’t give a fuck about the love life of a stranger. Ironic considering I’m posting this here). I think she knew they would judge her for what she did as the conversations and journal clearly showed, I was nothing but sweet and patient with her the whole time. She then told me she never wanted to speak to me again and that she hated me with every fiber of her being. The next day she had the **AUDACITY** to text one of my friends (not mutual) and ask why I was so sad at school (I looked like somebody just died) It was later confirmed that the texts were really her by a mutual friend and me and our now not so mutual friend have never to her spoken since. Now I’m stuck in the same Chemistry class as her but we avoid each other. I would have died for this girl if necessary and she threw away our best-friendship like it was a piece of garbage for no reason whatsoever. I sent her a text just after our fight saying that while we would never be friends again, if she ever apologized to me face to face, I would forgive her on the spot. She never responded. I still don’t think she truly understood just how much I loved her; and I never looked at love the same way again. Thank you for spending your time reading my story.

It can happen to anyone at any time.” Whenever I think about her, my heart skips a beat. Simply thinking about her sweetness, kindness, and beauty is enough to make me smile. Not a single day has gone by when I haven’t dozed off into a dream, because in my dreams, she loves me too. I’d dream that she and I would watch a scary movie together one night. She would clutch me tightly with every shrill sound and I’d comfort her with a big hug every time, telling her that everything’ll be okay. I’d also imagine that we’d play a musical duet together, go to a concert hall to listen to the sounds of an orchestra, or cuddle in front of the fireplace as it snows outside. However, my favorite one is where we’d go to the lake, go fishing, and lean upon each other’s shoulders as we talk for hours upon hours until the bright sun would set over the horizon. We’d then lie down together and look at the constellations as we slowly fell into a soft sleep in each other’s arms. But these are only dreams, a mirage and illusion of an alternate blue reality. Every time I lay my eyes upon hers, my heart aches, knowing that her cute eyes won’t be looking into mine the same way. Even though we are often mere meters apart from each other, it feels as if we are separated by the Atlantic Ocean. However, the most damning thing of all is that it hurts to hold her so close to your heart when you can’t even hold her by her hands. Whenever our paths cross, I smile and wave while I mourn inside, knowing that I won’t be seeing her until next week. Every day and moment was a perpetual reminder that she may not reciprocate those same feelings I have for her.

As the saying goes, “If you truly love someone, you must let them free. If they return to you, then they are yours. If they never come back, then they were never yours to begin with.” In the end, I only want her to be happy. No matter who she ends up with or where her life takes her, my ultimate desire is to see that beautiful smile radiate across her face. The greatest wish that sprouts from my love is to see her lead a productive and joyful life; One without heartbreak, grief, and anguish. I now realize that the power of love corresponds to the power of selflessness; The power to think beyond my own desires and feeling to care about another person. True love is not even the desire and longing to be with the one you love, but the desire to see her laugh, grin, and prosper for the rest of her life. That is how much I love her. That is how much I love you.

380,Can your soulmate have a different soulmate,"I’m going to start this off by saying I think I found my soulmate.

now, I know this may sound crazy coming from someone who’s 18 years old, but i really think I have.

this person (we’ll call them SM) came into my life 5 years ago, and we hit it off right from the first time we talked to each other.

we dated all through 8th and 9th grade but things came to an unfortunate end when he started to change and not be the person I’d fallen in love with. and so we separated, and it hurt.

somehow, we always managed to cross paths the following two years but I avoided trying to entertain conversation at all costs because I was so hurt. but finally, a flip switched and going into our senior year we were friends again and I honestly started to feel that spark again. he apologized for all of the stuff that happened in the past and I did too. four years later and we both really grew and changed, yet he was still the great person I knew from day one on the inside.

I could tell that there was something there and I knew he did too, but then enter in this girl, who he swears up and down is the love of his life. he wants to be with her forever and they’ve already been together for a while. if i’m being honest, I could see them making it the long run.

but then, what about me?

am I wrong to think that he’s “the one” for me? is it possible to be in love with someone when they’re in love with someone else?

can your soulmate have a different soulmate?

382,He looked at me and light up.,"There is this guy I met through some friends. I first saw him last summer at a church event (my friends are in a small group and invited to some of the events). It was ultimate frisbee, I had fun. It was the only event I went to with the small group, but that’s where I saw him. I was eyeing him the rest of the time we were playing. I didn’t really get to introduce myself to anyone since I joined in after they already started. 

Let’s fast forward to a couple weeks ago, I was invited by the same friends to a movie and pizza night at their place (still a church thing) I decided to go since it was at their place and I have been there before. A part of myself was like maybe he will be there. (Let me remind you, I do not even know his name). I’m there and well he wasn’t. We ended up playing games since their Blu-ray was broke, we were playing some games and then all of a sudden the door opens and everyone who was there yells this guys name, I look at the door and there he is. My flirty side comes out, even though I am awkward as hell. I just got my hair cut a few days prior so I was playing with my hair like crazy. As we continued playing games I would catch him looking at me and he would look away and vice versa. At the end of the night when we were all leaving he came up to me and held out his hand and introduced himself to me. I shook his hand and said my name. (This made me go to cloud nine, since a guy has never been like hey I want to know who you are, you seem interesting). 

Let’s go to this morning, I was told by one friend that I should go to the late service for church so I could see a certain person, cause all the young adults go to the late service. So I went, myself and my friends sister (whom I am much more closer too) are in the sanctuary and well we both see the guy and she was like well where do you want to sit? (As in like our normal spot or close to the guy) I said whatever so she grabs my arm and bee lines it to the front by the guy. He is facing forward and when we get closer he looks behind him and sees my friend first since she was in front of me. He then sees me and his face completely lights up, he smiles, his whole demeanor changes when he saw me. He gives me a nod and I smile. I was about to walk into the row to sit with him when my other friend comes up behind me scares the shit out of me ruining the moment. 

I had some personal things happen that I wasn’t able to stick around and chat with anyone. But I am hoping that things will turn around next week and we can actually talk. 


But I will say I have never had a guy look at me the way he did, it made me feel special. And I really hope that something will become of it. ",love,1552884032,_gr33nchucks,0,3,True,2019-03-18

388,"The most beautiful kind of love, is the one of most sacrifice.","I've known this girl for 10 years, and she's the only girl in my life that's managed to make me feel happy about who I am as a person. That's why I had to make a sacrifice.

Sacrificing yourself so another man can make her happier is the greatest sacrifice I made. It was the most painful thing I've ever had to do.

I've been busy with my job, but I still check on her weekly, to make sure she's happy and fulfilled with her new lover. I knew he didn't know her as well, and so I wanted to help him out.

Of course, names redacted. 

I sent him a letter. He hasn't met me before, so he's never seen my handwriting... But I did tell him this.

She loves it when you organize the foods according to the colour wheel. None of them should be out of place. When you tell her she's wrong, she knows she's wrong, she's a very open person that is willing to listen to you. She loves egg sandwiches, with ketchup in them. Tomatoes too, so add them in. She loves going outside, so get off your ass from gaming so much with her. She loves games, but she also loves trees. I remember taking her through the forest and watching her gape her mouth in awe, when we came to a cliff side and looked out into the distance. She's also clumsy, she actually almost tripped off the cliff that day too. She doesn't like cuddling. Not at all. Her love language is listening to you using your words. Tell her how much she's worth, in Bitcoin, in Robux, whatever value you can put, just multiply it by infinity. She loves those cheesy approaches. She loves dogs too, so try to get a dog yourself. It's difficult at first, but you'll love him within less than 30 seconds. 

And also, I told him not to tell her about this letter. Just remember these things about her. 

I've now known her for 14 years... And her wedding was only a week ago. She has a dog named Susie, an egg themed wedding... And a man that kept whispering beautiful things into the microphone whenever he spoke. He knew how to make her smile. 

Me? I wasn't actually invited. I never could have been. All I know is what I heard from my aunt. She knows how much I loved her... And she knew why I had to let her go. It was a good decision. 

It still hurts, though. I sacrificed my own happiness for hers... It was perfect... Yet painful. Satisfying, yet destructive. I still imagine her being the young girl that told me I was the best person she'd ever met. That I was her world. That I should be her husband in 4 years time. That whatever pain I was going through, she wanted to go through it with me, and have me continue being the strong person that makes her smile everyday she sees me. 

She once told me that love is full of sacrifices. I wonder sometimes, did she ever know? If she did, did she care? 

All I know is, it's the middle of the night. I'm looking at the happier times we had... And wondering how she forgot everything about me. She forgot all the love and support we gave one another. She forgot my name, my person, my very existence. It seemed as if... I never existed in her eyes all of a sudden... And all this just came rushing down... It hurts. I don't know how or why she forgot about me... But I did my part to make her happy... And with that, I am forced to bid her adieu. Maybe... That love never existed in the first place.

389,And then we hugged,"This one is for all of you who feel lonely

(Disclaimer: I wrote this post originally for r/pornfree but I thought it would fit in here quite well too.) 

If you feel lonely, sad, terrified, and broken, porn is a convenient thing to escape your reality for a few moments. Don´t. Go hug someone you care about and who cares for you. Talk, talk all night if need be. Then hug some more. 

During this intense group project for University I met someone really special and she gave me the most important realization of my life, as far as emotional wellbeing is concerned. **We tend to see sex as the ultimate conclusion to emotional well being. I would like to contend that notion vigorously because of my experience over the last week.** Please bear with me as I have to lay out the situation a bit: 

* I separated from my girlfriend after more than 4 years and it has emotionally rattled every aspect of my life. Often I would have to run home because I couldn´t hold back the tears any longer. Sometimes I cried so hard my legs wouldn´t work anymore. The pressure from my workplace and the labour intensive project made my life really hard for the last months. I never felt more alone in my life. 
* My group project partner was in a similar situation, dumped by some guy she really loved, without even being given a proper explanation. Having sky high expectations as to career as well as social life that never seemed to be met. Ofcourse pressure in the work place and also the project made her life a living hell. 

So there it is, this paradox, two young, attractive, well dressed and smart individuals, on a paid trip to one of the most reputable Universities in the world, to present the project we have been working on for almost a year. We had every reason to be happy and excited. Rather we were tired, sad, heartbroken and most importantly terribly alone in a foreign country. Over the course of the project, we grew closer and closer and I´d say, real friendship ensued. So, in the evening of the first of four days of the trip, we were both in a really bad place. The perfect moment to just go to my hotel room and binge on porn. But we started crying together because both of us could not take it anymore.   


**And then we hugged.**

&amp;#x200B;

Not one of these fake hugs. A real hug, where you can feel the other persons heartbeat, where your necks touch, where you really hold each other close. She tenderly caressed the back of my head and kissed me on my cheek. It was the most beautiful thing anyone ever did for me.   


We continued to talk, to hug and caress each other until late late at night. We cried and we laughed, we didn´t even bother to get out of our uncomfortable business shoes. ***We didn´t feel the need to kiss or even have sex***. It would have altered the emotional connection, it would have transformed our deep friendship into something we were afraid of not being helpful to ourselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

Late at night she left my hotel room to get some sleep at her room. The next day we still were friends, even more tired than before but somehow, oddly content. We knew we had each other, we knew we understood the others situation, we knew we wouldn´t have made it to where we stood without each other.  We knew that we were two broken pieces that somehow got tangled up together to form a whole that was actually capable of navigating life again.  

&amp;#x200B;

I´ll admit, I thought about kissing her, there were plenty of moments where it would have been perfect. I´ll even admit that I was wondering, whether I was developping romantic feelings for her. I am more than happy to say that the abstinence from porn has changed my being to crave emotional connection more than sex. **The value of just having each other at our side was worth more than any sexual experience and any romantic adventure.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I am more than convinced that getting away from porn during the last three years has oppened me to this deep realization, that emotional connection and tenderness are more powerful than any negative emotion, even more powerful than sex. Maybe porn has lead to this mistaken belief. Maybe that is why marriages fail, if sex is the ultimate conclusion, a long term partner often can not compete with (a) porn, or (b) another human that comes along. 

  
Let me know what you think. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this is somewhat readable and coherent, I´m still not sure what exactly happened. The only thing I´m sure about is that I´m not so terribly sad and alone anymore thanks to this realization.

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers and all the best to you

Three days ago I cheated on her by pure sexual pulsion, I didn’t thought about the repercussions, right after I realised my mistake I called her saying that I was sorry I was shaking, my girl is perfect in any way and our relationship was the strongest ever, I have so many regrets because she is the love of my life, we discussed about it and we are crying all day she cant look me in my eyes and she wants to forgive me but she needs time.
I feel so much guilt and pain to see her in this position has I still love her and want to get her trust back, I take all responsibilities of this and don’t want to search for an excuse but I really want her she’s the love of my life and I have ruined everything..

She don’t trust my words when I say I love her and I’m ready to do anything to save our relationship
I love this girl from the bottom of my heart and our relationship was perfect, I called my friend and they told me to not say anything before I called her to tell her the truth, she dont deserve to be lied to, I want to be honest with her because she’s an angel, ive broken her heart in pieces and it’s really hard, I feel real love for her I know I should have think about it but I know this is the biggest mistake in my life..
I deserve to be treated like the coward that I am but I really need this girl and I think about how she feel It’s breaking me from the bottom of my heart

395,Update: M29 tells me F30 he loves me…,"I recently posted  ""**He called me his girlfriend, skeeeee!""** about how I was falling in love with this boy I met thru Bumble. The details of our background can be found there, but to summarize quickly for those of you who haven’t read the previous post:

We both got out of long term 5+ year relationships with our significant others this past fall. Both of us turned to the powers of technology vica vee dating apps to find a casual hookup. Hey, we’re human, we haz needs!

Anyways, both of us did not know how to do this. I’ll never forget how our  first “date” ended up with us sitting in my car, because I was too nervous to meet him in the café. We just talked and talked and talked about random shit, and also we discussed STDs ‘cause…we’re here to bang, lol.

This casual tryst slowly began evolving over the months. Both of us were in different places emotionally, both grieving, in pain, hurting, crying, healing our hearts because we had thought our past S.O.s were it. They were the ones. We imagined lives together…forever. And for different reasons…I dumped my S.O. for many reasons the biggest being he was mentally unstable and began abusing drugs, and the darling boy I love now, let’s call him Egg, was dumped because his S.O. thought they weren’t a good fit.

Egg was everything I wanted, but never knew was out there, waiting for me, waiting to love me… He’s kind, passionate, thoughtful, funny, cute, caring, fellow nerd, adorable, creative, smart, organized, genuine…He’s the full package…also he bakes/cooks, and will bring me flowers/cards for no damn reason other than me being me. Who is this Hallmark man? 

I digress, back to us falling in love and him “confessing” his love to me…

Over months of us hanging out…just chilling at each other’s places doing our weird shit some of which is mundane, but it all is life and adds up…playing League of Legends/Nintendo Switch stuff, board games, cuddling, watching cheesy movies “They Live”, playing Dungeons and Dragons (him playing with his friends online, me listening in and loving all the funny stuff), Christmas decorating, Valentine’s exchanges, finding him a new apartment, moving him into his new apartment, running errands, folding laundry, doing yoga together (I’m also a yoga nerd), baking sweets (pies, cookies) and cooking and of course lots of kissing and hooking up thrown in there too for good measure!!!

Somewhere in the middle of all this stuff we fell in love. 

I knew I loved him, and please I know this sounds cheesy, but I knew after we exchanged our Valentine’s. Ya, okay it’s around a made-up holiday meant to sell candy and cards and crap, but damn it, this guy, my Egg fudging baked me his family recipe pumpkin pie from scratch. 

**A couple things he:**

1. Remembered me saying pumpkin pie is my favorite pie

2. Planned ahead – grocery shopping, time to bake pie etc, even grabbed the whipped cream as I told him I like a little pie with my whipped cream. Ya, I glob it on like no one’s business.

3. From scratch, like he roasted an effing pumpkin or whatever the hell it is you do. He did not get canned. He also made his own crust, there were zero cheats in this bake, and he did this for me.

4. He delivered the pie to me, along with a card, of course.

Now I knewwwwwwwwww, **KNEW**, I loved this guy, when he gave me this most amazing display of affection, time, effort, thoughtfulness, and to top it off on the weirdy we meant for each other vibes, we both had somehow given each other Yoda cards. Okay, sure *Star Wars* is pretty all around us, it’s kinda like the force…you feel it. But this felt so funny and perfect, and meant to be since, okay, everyone don’t judge me. We were watching that ridiculous ""SEAGULLS! (Stop It Now)"" -- A Bad Lip Reading of The Empire Strikes Back. And after we watched it I told him I had this silly fantasy of hopping on his back and pretending I’m Yoda, just to be a goofball. We laughed about that, and anyways, the seed of Yoda was planted in our brains I guess, which is why this greeting card matching set happened.

Now the days and weeks are passing by, things happen. We continue to hang out, grow closer, share more laughs, more hook-ups, more silly shenanigans. Egg was def going through some shit, I could see his heart was NOT over his ex. He would still bring up his ex a decent amount, along with having some really down depressed days, and he was honest about it, much like I was with him. Although mine ended much more sadly/rocky/painful it still hurt and I still missed that person I once fell in love with. That guy who could make some random little sound which meant something, just between the two of us and it would make me laugh til my sides hurt. 

But here we were in the present, healing our hearts and finding comfort and love in another person we didn’t think was even possible. My heart was bursting to tell him after I knew I loved him and I almost slipped a couple times. In fact the very next time we saw each other I only got away with saying I loved him because I was pretending my dog was saying it. (I do a silly voice for my dog).

I told Gregg that I knew he was still getting over his ex and that he would have bad days, but that good things come to those who wait, and all the best things take time. I could be patient. And also there’s things I want to share with you but you’re not ready yet. I desperately wanted to tell him I loved him, but I wanted to let him get over his ex, and feel openly/free to tell me he loved me first. I didn’t want to pressure him/nor impose my intense feelings.

So this weekend  we were hanging out, playing video games and such, we decided to chill in his bed for kisses and cuddles. One thing inevitably leads to another and let’s say we took it to warp 9, ya dig? Okay, pause for comedic effect. Whilst he is still inside of me on top, he says he has something important that he’s been wanting to say. I, not one to be great with my feelings am kinda freaking out. I usually hide under a blanket or a pillow or something when he tells me these things, but with him on top of me there was literally no where to hide. I even told him this, I was like, “I can’t hide under a blanket with you on top of me!!!” He laughed, and then he told me he loved me. 

My heart soared, I felt like I was in a dream. I seriously couldn’t process the information he was telling me. He said so many things to that I can’t recall verbatim, but they were all very nice, heartwarming sweet reasons why he felt the way he did about me. I told him shyly that I loved him too. Even though I’ve been dying to tell him, I still felt shy about saying the words out loud. It felt dangerous or maybe it’s just being vulnerable like that which twirls those butterflies around in my tummy. 

He loves me. I love him. Yes, I’m an effing adult, but my heart skips a beat thinking about him and also he’s called me his girlfriend. Before we were just friends hooking up, but we’ve gone beyond that, and THAT makes me so happy.  I can call him my boyfriend! My wonderful boyfriend, that I love.

At some point in our many hangs he told me I’m the fastest person to ever become this close to him in such a short time frame. He’s usually more closed off apparently and takes a long time to let people in. I am rather similar. I usually keep my heart guarded and tucked away, and I hide my emotions/true weird self because I’m scared of rejection. But he was always so kind and so patient with me. I instantly knew I could trust him, but I had to give myself time to lower my guard. 

Long story short I’m in love with someone who loves me too. I only hope this never stops. I don’t want to sound like a crazy girl, but I want to marry him. I seriously can not imagine myself with anyone else, nor do I want to. He’s an amazing human being that I could see myself spending the rest of my life with. I’m ready for the next adventure and I really hope it’s with him…always!

Feeling dreamy, in love, and hoping for forever,

. i won’t believe that love is a feeling. yes, there is a feeling of love. but love is not a feeling. love is beautiful, raw and you have to be committed. you won’t have that feeling for the rest of your life but once you decide to LOVE someone for real, now that is forever. that decision is yours to make. are you ready to be with them for the rest of your life? are you ready to go through hell and back with them? are you ready to give them your all? these are the questions you ask yourself before you said “i love you”, before you make a choice to marry somebody. i feel like a lot of people don’t know what the real meaning of love is, we don’t know how to commit. now a days we love people who treat us like garbage, and for what? because you’re used to it. stop letting people treat you like shit and own up and be the boss ass bitch you are.

but i have not talked to her in months, i barely see her around and i doubt she has any feelings toward me, but picturing her with someone else makes me feel sad. she is not going to the same college as me, and i don’t want to feel heartbroken or whatever, whenever we finally graduate. 

i cannot bring myself to even send her a snap let alone talk to her in person. i just don’t know what to do, i have never felt this way about anyone ever, but now i do not know what to do, whenever i see her i find comfort that i am seeing her for that split second

403,What does it mean to be in love?,"To be in love is staying on the phone for hours even if we don't say anything.
To be in love is texting all day even if we don't have anything to talk about. 
To be in love is just staring at their face on facetime with the biggest smile. 
To be in love is trying to sneak up on them whenever they turn their back on you.
To be in love is tackling them when they're just chilling.
To be in love is to pause and realize just how much you love them.
To be in love is to wake up in their arms and stare at their resting face.
To be in love is to feel thousands of fuzzy emotions even if you're not with them. 
To be in love is different for everyone, even this post.

Here’s background if it may make things clearer:

So about 2 years ago I fell in love with this amazing girl. She was absolutely perfect.  In my eyes she was a 10.  I had all those super lovey-dovey feelings for her even when we argued and after we moved past the honeymoon stage.  We dated for about a year, and then she cheated and dumped me for someone else.  I was heartbroken for a while but now I’ve learned to grow and become better.

So what I was wondering is do you guys think I’ve missed my chance at a true love?  Or what type of love is that?

Anyways, so I come from a family of 7, 5 siblings and I am the youngest. The oldest is about 40. I got an internship in California for this summer and my parents have known about it for awhile. My sister is getting married in a month and she would be the last one to leave the house. 

I just revisited the topic of my internship with my mom over FT and I guess she assumed the internship would be like a week or something because when I told her it was 3 months she looked like a deer in headlights. Long story short, she told me that made her sad and that she was stressed because the wedding is getting closer. I think it’s hitting her finally that I am no longer a baby and that she and my dad will be living alone, alone. I mean, me and my siblings will always visit and the closest one to them is my brother who’s an hour away and he has 3 kids. I think it’s so bitter sweet that my parents are old and about to retire and getting the rest and peace they deserve for raising 5 kids. Bless my parent’s hearts. I love and miss them so much.

409,Will he come back?,"I met this guy on tinder back in December, things were well, off and on. I found out a little bit about him, he smokes weed daily, blacked out drunk every weekend, &amp; his friends aren’t the greatest (depression plays a roll). I have always had a feeling he may be depressed but he hasn’t really came to me and said he is. There was a time back in January on his bday where he snapped me at 4 am and I replied at 7 am and he replied quickly after, it was weird and he’s told me he rarely sleeps / can’t fall asleep much. So I wonder if he has depression? Again he’s NEVER said he does or doesn’t . 

In February, he went on a business trip we didn’t talk for 6 days. He came back to me when he came back to our state, he kind of explained kind of didn’t in a way. aren’t dating btw. 
Two weeks ago, I told him I was coming home for spring break (we are in college &amp; are an hour away from each other but our hometown is the same), he told me he was going away for the entire week, well, I’m not sure if he really did go away or didn’t go away because he didn’t post anything on Snapchat for the entire week which was last week. We didn’t talk last week at all either so we haven’t spoken since March 8th. 

But it’s just confusing &amp; it’s upsetting me, especially since he was always the one to offer to hang out/meet up. He flirts a lot, he replies quick, &amp; he always starts the conversation with me. 

From the very start he did say “I’m not looking for a relationship at the moment I just don’t think I could handle one” but he knew that I was looking for a relationship, so I just don’t get it. He also would say things like “never thought you’d be interested in me” etc, so what gives here? I don’t understand. Was I the issue? Is it me? Am I just not good enough? Why would he keep talking to me for 3 months nearly ? Was he interested?he’s said before “I never thought you’d be interested in me”, we are not dating we haven’t met anyways. But it just is confusing and upsets me. 

He’s been out of a relationship for 2 years, his last relationship ended badly he told me.

410,Met this wonderful girl,"So this january I went on a cruise in the caribbeans. Me and my family often go on trips and stuff like that at that time of year, but this year something happened I just can't get over. On the first night of the cruise, just hanging out, I met this girl and damn is she the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. We started talking but it was pretty awkward at first since I am a shy person, and I could tell she was too. Anyway we talked and hung out for a few hours,we had fun so we planned to meet up the next day.

This went on for pretty much the whole cruise, everyday we hung out, talked, ate some food, played games, watched movies, ate some more food together. We could spend entire days from morning to 1-2am and never get tired of it. She was the most amazing girl I'd ever met, and it's fair to say I developped a pretty major crush on her. 

But of course all good things must come to an end, I got her number and her snapchat and we both went home, me in Canada and her in North Carolina. I didn't tell her how I felt before 2 weeks ago, when we were chatting. I told her and to my suprise she said she felt the same way and my heart skipped like 20 beats. Her answer made me so happy, but I realise I have a mutual crush on a girl that lives 8 hours away from me, and I might never see her again. We wanna try to arrange something to meet up but it's in a long time, and I'm not so sure if it's a good idea now...

419,What does it mean to be romantically in love with someone,"High schooler over here and I just realized that I have no idea what romantic love is. How do other people get into relationships so easily? And are there requirements for a person to be in love? I know I sound like a robot but I just feel like everything I’ve been “taught” about romance is all just artificial and over saturated. I think love is a bit overrated. I mean you hear it everywhere in movies, school (dances), and especially in music. Yeah love is a good feeling but I feel like with mass media it oversimplifies it  and makes you feel like you’re missing out on something great. But you’re really not. When the time comes it’ll be there but people shouldn’t be sad about not being in a relationship. 

Anyways I wanted to ask what it means to romantically fall in love? Is it based on their looks and personality? Their capabilities?

So it all started when I was in second year (2016). One day, I was standing with my friends and across the pathway, she was there standing with her group. By just looking at her I was stunned. That smile, her hair, her eye glasses, her tall stature was just perfect. I smiled at her. She smiled back. I was in love with her. I don't know what just happened but I just fall for her  at that very moment. I didn't do anything that day and thought may be I'll approach her some other day. 

Days passed, months passed and I just loooked at her, smiled and gone. I just couldn't gather myself and ask her out. (my biggest mistake)

Fast forward to last few days. I gathered myself up and walked up to her. She was coming towards me and my heart was beating at super high rate. I couldn't utter a single word and she just walked away. 

I told my brother about this. He told me if I cannot talk upfront, I should send her request on Instagram. I was not sure about this, but I did it anyway. She didn't accept it yet and I think she won't. 

We are passing out now. After this summer, I don't think I will ever see her again. I wanted to tell her everything that how I feel about her and how much I love her. But it's too late. 

I wanted to tell all of this to someone so here I am, pouring my heart out on this subreddit.

There's a boy, he has a crush on me, and I him. I think it's pretty obvious, but maybe not.

He once spent an hour trying to make a trick shot in front of me. 

Anyways, we were walking and I was a pace or two ahead of him. We were coming to a closed gate. He jumped ahead if me and held it open for me. Not the first time he's held a door for me, but definitely the sweetest ☺️

I'm not a very touchy person, but I always let him hug me goodbye, because I do mind it from him. Usually I go for a side hug (painfully awkward, I know) but this time he gave me a real hug.

427,The saddest thing I’ve ever witnessed,"[TL:DR: my step grandma doesn’t remember that her husband of 65+ years has passed away. She regularly forgets he’s dead and we have to break her heart all over again  ]

Soo my mom and stepdad are amazing people with huge selfless hearts. Recently, when Bs father (H) died, they brought Bs mom (W) to live with them, because she has dementia. H and B had been married over 65 years, they started dating when they were 13 years old. So, his death was obviously devastating for her. She’s going to need the care of a home pretty soon, but my parents couldn’t stand to have her put in a home right after she lost her life partner. I have so much respect for them.

What I don’t understand, is how they’re dealing with the heartbreaking reality W is living in. She can’t retain much information, and regularly forgets important things such as where she is, where she lives, and the fact that her dear husband Has passed away. The following convo is something I witnessed last week, that I can’t stop thinking about. 

W: have you heard from cliff lately?
W: I don’t understand why he hasn’t called or come to see me
M: oh mom,  remember, cliff is in heaven. He passed away a couple months ago. I’m so so sorry
W: voice cracking- oh, oh.. that’s right. I forgot. I forgot he’s in heaven now (starts crying) 

I just sat there in complete shock. My heart hurt so badly for her. I’m 28 and haven’t had a relationship longer than a couple of semesters, so the idea of losing a partner of 65+ years is something I can’t even imagine. But what I really can’t wrap my head around, is having to go through that moment over and over again. For months. Hands down the saddest moment I’ve ever witnessed. Hug your family. Cherish them.

432,"Tired, but not retired - Your's Ex."," Tired, but not retired - Your's Ex.

I have expressed my love to her with virility. She also accepted it by with a lot of enthusiasm. We synergized our love daily in the mobile phone, and she makes me awake by making video call in the morning. We both are software engineers. But we are working for different organization.

Both of them are anticipatory awaited for the weekend. We would go for junket, but we won't exceed our cultural boundaries. Sometimes my friends compelled me to have hard drinks. With her assent I will drink the same to my brawn. She is also amiable person with a lot of contemporary views.

Even though we go for the jamboree, we both consumed our most of the breathing space in the beach. She teased me lot. I would take it as toddler. Sometimes she encouraged me if I found any hardship in my profession. She is a very good costume designer. It is not her profession, but she gives me many corrections in my dressing. She is very beautiful, and she has the good complexion. Every poet like her alluring eyes. I wonder whether she is having a hip or not. Totally she is slim good-looking amazing woman.

Sometimes because of my work pressure, it is not possible to me to accompany her on weekends. At that moment she would send some worst comments through WhatsApp, and she also calls me and scold me with numerous unparliamentary words. But I never react for that and in reply I would be silent. Very next day she would ask apology to me for her childish behaviour.

Today is our first year anniversary of our love. We already planned to celebrate the event in good manner with very close friends. In that function she wore traditional kancheepuram pattu saree and I have worn pattu dhothi and pattu shirt. She seemed to be gorgeous. Friends greeted us, and some friends sang a song. Overall function is full of fun and joyful. Really it has been unforgettable moments in my life.

Next day morning she awakes me as usual by making video call in mobile phone. In the evening she asked to meet her at the beach. Even though I am very busy with my work I committed for that.

She is eagerly waiting for me and after looking me, she stepped for distance towards me and very first time she hugged me and gives a long kiss. It is not on lips, but it is on my cheek. She conveyed that she was going for states for an important project. And she also told that her the time period of the project is only three months. I become very silent.

She convinced me and finally I have accepted her commitment. In the beginning, she came daily in Skype, and we would speak a lot. I would tell I missed her a lot. Sometimes I would cry as young child on before of her. She also repeats it. Valentine division is really unbearable pain. Slowly the communication between us became less. The lack of communication is not because of me, and it is her bungle.

At one stage she permanently stopped her connection from her side. So many times I tried to speak with her. But I can’t get her line. I am becoming an island in our love. Many negative thoughts come in my mind, and I am totally confused. I have contacted her head office in Chennai regarding her current status. They reported me that at present she is working at remote place nearby Texas. I have not satisfied with their words. Still, I have a lot of factuality on her that why she is not calling or come on Skype.

Three months went very fast, but not a single call from her side. With a lot of audacity, straightly I went to her house and asked about her status. They told that her project is extended for again three months. I am totally fed up and went to bar very first time. Next day with the heavy headache I wake up and reported to my senior that I want ten days leave. He agreed and sanctioned immediately.

I am totally disturbed, and I have decided to make a tour to kodaikanal. I have packed my baggage and booked a ticket by bus to kodaikanal. Before leaving from Chennai, finally I have made a call to her. No response from her side. It's really mystery what happened to her.

The bus to the hill station supposes to start. Excellent seating arrangements with the centralized air-conditioned bus attracted me, and it slowly started from the depot and because of heavy traffic bus takes more time reach main road. With the help of headphone, hearing my favourite songs, my journey started. Nearly a long period of a gap I am landed kodaikanal. Its winter season, temperature went to the minus. Ten days I have switched off my phone and enjoyed the hill station climate as free bird. Stress less, pollution less, peaceful atmosphere with full of satisfaction, I am becoming new man.

Half heartedly I departed from kodaikannal. Resumed work again with new enthusiasm. Finishing lunch checked my mail. I have stuck with one mail. It’s from my lover.

Monday, peak hours, everywhere traffic, my junior associate is waiting for the cab at the bus stop. Stopped my car and asked her to get into the car. With a smiling face she accepted my request. She looks very modern, and the fragrance she used makes inside the whole car pleasing and created pleasant atmosphere. Without any nervousness I told her she was very beautiful and also asked her to meet me after office hours. Again with a beautiful smile she said yes.

This weekend I booked a hotel for us spur of the moment. She’s wanted to go downtown together for a while. I hope she loves it. I love bringing a smile to her face. We have so much sexual and intellectual comparability. She’s brilliant even though she doesn’t think so. It’s her mind and her conversation that first drew me to her. 

I’m so happy to have her and I hope that I can get my life going more for her soon so I can help her out. She’s going through a rough time but I know her brilliance and perseverance will get her through it. I hope she has a great birthday today and I wish so badly that I could have surprised her.

I tried too, so many times, it just doesn't work. So much so that this girl still haunts my dreams, always a kind supporting character in them, with the lucidity that she is still no longer mine.

438,He’s an angel.,"I haven’t been easy to love lately. I’m a mess of anxiety and insecurities that can’t be easy for my wonderful boyfriend to deal with. I’ve been going to counseling and recently tried a new anxiety medicine that not only made everything worse but also gave me insomnia. So now on top of my glowing personality I’m exhausted. 

Last night my boyfriend drove our dogs and I out to the beach, we watched the sunset and poked around in tide pools. It was absolutely beautiful and perfect. When we got home I sat down and cozied up in a blanket. That sweet angel of a man cooked us dinner, cleaned it up AND put some in a container for my lunch today.  

I don’t know what I did to deserve such a wonderful partner, but him being able to stick by me while I try to sort out all of this mental health stuff is the sweetest thing he could do. 

Thank you for loving me at my worst, Saucy.

I first saw it when I was spooning you watching a film. I remember being one the happiest I’ve ever been, just everything seemed perfect in that moment and I just wanted to remember every single detail of that moment. My memory is so bad as you know but I really couldn’t lose that moment and I was looking around the room trying to imprint every inch of it into my brain, and as I was focusing on the room my eyes drifted to the back of your head, and it almost appeared out of nowhere and I saw that little freckle on the back of your ear. And it just felt so good to find this, this thing that I feel like no one else knows about but me, and it just made me feel so much more closer to you and so much more intimate with you. And every time I see that little freckle or it crosses my mind I think back to that moment, and I can fully remember every feeling, happiness and content and just pure love that I’ve never felt before in that way. The way that I find myself frantically trying to remember every moment I spend with you because they are the most precious and important moments in my life. And that is how I knew I was in love, and that’s why I have a favourite freckle.

443,I Friendzoned my crush so she could be happy,"This is kind of a sad story. none of my friends know I have reddit and I kinda need to vent so someone understands. I'm kinda half suffering and half just going with it. this story probably seems bullshit and cringey but I dont care. no one will read this anyway and I just need to vent.

here goes nothing.

Awhile ago I got my crushes phone number (I had been crushing on her for like 2 years). keep in mind this isn't just someone who I Like with my eyes. this is the one person who's personality is just the greatest (shes also very beautiful). anyways, we were texting and I found out that she was sort of emotionally scarred from the past two relationships she has had. so I let her vent and let her know that I could relate.  I got to know her really well before our grade got to go to Washington dc for a field trip. I thought this would be the perfect bonding opportunity, because we would basically be together for  a week. so anyways, it was about the 3rd out of 5 days and I was sitting next to a kid who was more of an aquaintence than a friend and he all of the sudden tells me that a girl just sent him a heart. I responded something like, ""Oooooooo (kid) has a girlfriend!"" followed by, ""who is it?"". He tells me the name of the person I had trying to get to know for the past couple of weeks. My stomach drops. I say, ""Cool"" and put on my headphones and listen to some X because he is a good artist and it was kind of what I was in the mood for. we Get back to the hotel and I just collapse on the bed. I thought sleep would help and it did sort of. when I woke up I knew what I had to do.the next day (last day in DC) I texted her and got into a conversation and then said, ""You know, I lowkey ship you and (kid)"" she responded with,""thanks!"". It absolutely killed me to do that but I felt that it was needed. The last thing she needs or deserves are 2 guys fighting over her. and If she decides she likes a different guy, then who am I to stand in her way. I don't want the be the one who cant let go. Since then I have retreated to just being the nice guy. and I know this sounds really corny and cringey but I, a second-rate weird teenager with some serious problems doesn't deserve someone as great as her. And they seem really happy together so that makes me think that I made the right choice.

You were the first of many. Its been so long that ive forgotten your face, but Ill never forget the fun you showed me. You were wild, but I never saw you as a jerk. When you were taken away, I hoped for weeks you would come home again. I still hope youre okay Spike.

Im basically writing this on behalf of my mother. She found you, and loved you more than anything, and she was the only one you ever trusted. My heart breaks a little when she thinks the stranger down the road is you. Your son was also very loved. I couldnt stand to see him gone so young. Skipper, Mischief, I hope you've been reunited.

It was very cold when you literally walked into our lives. I remember when you first let me cuddle you on that couch. The entire family loved your pure bred charm. As you fade from my memory, I can still hear your calls. We miss you Buttons.

When my first love dumped me, I was alone. I had no other friends to count on but you. You helped me out of that hole by simply existing for the brief period I knew you. You were taken from me so fast that I never got the chance to recover. Im looking at your collar as I type this all out, hoping your presence is still around. Are ghosts real?

I am very sad right now..,"I was about to ask her out today, but before that I wanted to be sure whether she was single or not. So purposely shifted our convo topic to crushes, breakups etc so that I can ask her ""btw do you have a bf?"". And i did ask her and this was her reply:
Her: uhh maybe..(she said smiling)
Me: (i was shocked beyond believe and couldnt believe this was happening so i didnt even utter a word)
Her: well they are my best friends (the bf and a girl she was talking about earlier)
Me: so that dude is your boyfriend?
Her: (she nodded while smilling shyly)
Me: soo do you guys like go on a date?
Her: yeah he comes to see me everyday.

That is when I died inside. :(( I was so happy spending time with her, she is the one. And today was the day I was finally gonna ask her out but then this happened...

Also btw the convo wasnt exactly like that, there were alot of emotions and other small questions asked in between what i wrote. Just wanted to give u guys a gist of what happened. I dont think my heart can recover from this. 

I dont know how I'll move on. I don't think I'll ever find a girl like her. I am always happy around her, just talking to her for few min would make my day. But now everything I ever pictured is ruined. 

I wish she didnt have a bf, i wish her bf didnt exist. Why God why. I can't bear this. I feel so down and I feel so done rn. I love her so much why couldn't i be the one? Fuck her boyfriend. :'((((( ahhhhhhhhh

458,Can you love someone too much?,"**Can two people love each other way too much? Or am I making excuses? What do you think?**

I think you can love someone to the point where it's just too much. You have this intense desire to be together always, to the point where it becomes unhealthy. You love the other person so absurdly much that in your mind they become some kind of mythical being. You are placing each other on a pedestal so high it just becomes ridiculous. To the point where it's better to just be good friends. A relationship where you just talk to each other. Take care of each other as friends. Laugh together. Support each other. Have fun. But both of you accept that romance is just too much. You just have to let that aspect go. So both of you can live a normal life.

Maybe I'm making excuses for why it didn't work. But I've come to this conclusion after realizing that I just can't be with the girl I love more than anything in this world. I thought that only she could ever make me happy. But here I am. I'm actually happy and in love with another girl. And so is the first girl with another guy. We love each other. But we are friends. And, at least for now, it's better like this. 

For over 10 years we had this special relationship. We were friends that loved each other. We often called each other things like ""baby"" and ""my treasure"". We looked at each other full of love and lust. It was too extreme to just be friends. But it was never an actual romantic relationship. And only recently it had become sexual. She was in love with me before. I didn't understand. Then I was finally in love with her. She chose to be with another guy. I couldn't understand. Why would she go for this ""mild"" love? Why would she want just a ""boring"" relationship, when with me she could finally have this burning passion? This intense love that we both wanted to give each other for 10 years. It was finally time for our intense love to explode into the greatest relationship ever. But she avoided it. 

I went insane. I did extremely stupid things. I was mad at her. I was jealous. I told her not to talk to me anymore, even though I see her almost every day. I missed her. I wanted to die. I just couldn't understand. And she couldn't explain. Or at least everything she tried to say I couldn't accept. I was under intense stress because of it. Then I tried to move on. I went on a date with another girl. She is wonderful. But I felt so intensely bad that I was moving on. I felt guilty and thought I was cheating. I thought I was ruining everything with the first girl. I went to the date with the second girl and literally passed out after saying hi. I fainted and fell flat on my face in a busy cafe. Right in front of the girl. The stress became too much to handle. 

I hit rock bottom. I realized I had to let go of the first girl. And that she had to let go of me. We had to go back to being best friends. That way we wouldn't have to miss each other. But we couldn't be lovers. That was just too much. We agreed. It was what she had realized earlier when she went for the other guy. 

The second girl sat with me in the ambulance and held my hand. She lovingly caressed my chest and my head. She made me calm when I was scared. This was on our very first date, two days after we met. I thought she would think I'm weak. In her eyes I walked into a cafe, saw her, and fainted. The next day she didn't ""run away"". Instead she video called me early in the morning. I told her not to look so sexy next time cause she'd make me faint again. She said ""Don't faint"", gave me a nice view of herself in bed and told me ""See, you'll be fine"". She gave me my confidence back. She wanted another date. But just simple chicken nuggets at McDonald's this time. That's what we did. It was great. She is pretty. She is so much fun. She is so cute. She takes care of me. I take care of her. We are slowly falling in love. Like normal people. I want to be with her. But it's not extreme. It's not intense. And that's OK. We've been very cheesy, for example texting each other ""Good morning ❤️"" every morning since we met. We are becoming a couple that has a ""mild"" and ""boring"" love. And I'm so happy with that. Cause that's normal. My stress is gone. I'm calm. I'm having fun. Everything is better like this.

I plan on before prom even starts asking her by taking her hand,  getting down on one knee and saying this ""Lexi you have made me so happy, you have been my best friend in times of need my girlfriend when I needed you to be and I couldn't ask for better, Lexi ""middle name"" ""last name"" will you do me the favor of being mine forever and marry me"" I hope she says yes and lets me stay with her forever.

465,The Words You Deserve to Hear,"I’ve been struggling to find what I want to say and have the words mean what I’ve been wanting them to mean. My selfishness has been coming out as everything so far has focused on me and how I feel and going on the defense. That’s so beyond wrong and less than you deserve. That’s not an apology, it’s a sub par excuse for being a terrible person in hopes that it will be excused. 

In spite of how I have acted the last few days, you deserve to be reminded that you are amazing and more than I deserve, especially right now. 

You are possibly the most patient person on earth, or at least when it comes to the emotional roller coaster I put you through. My struggles with myself, my struggles with my home life, my self worth, my value. I put you through hell constantly with my lack of self esteem. Just dealing with that alone as much as you do probably puts you on saint level.

You have never torn me down. Not once. You won’t let anyone try to break me down, not even myself. You are my biggest champion and my greatest hero against anything that may even think about hurting me, even myself. Your ability to pull me out of the depths of absolutely dark self loathing. You just remind me every single day that I have worth. 

I love your ability to love. It’s completely unconditional, even when by every other stretch that I wouldn’t think that I deserve it. I love your compassion and how fiercely you love. I know you struggle with not letting go, and honestly as much as it may hurt , I love your ability to not let go, because it’s also your ability to see the good and hope for the best in others. 

I love your intellect. I love watching you stay informed on the world around you. I love your passion for the things you care about. I love when you teach me something new that I am completely clueless on. I love watching you fix whatever it is a managed to break on my phone, again. 

I love your humor. I love listening to your stories. I love it when you whisper some completely inappropriate but hilarious joke only I can hear. I love how you do everything you can to make me smile, even on my darkest days. 

I love how you make me feel. How being near makes my heart race. How your voice just puts me complete peace. How your glance makes me completely weak. How your smell practically makes me drunk off you. How you touch electrifies every part of my body, constantly craving more. How your smile could makes me want to be unclothed. 

You are the best of the best. Never forget it. Not even for a second ",love,1553142229,pamelagranger89,3,50,True,2019-03-21

467,Not safe for work,"Tears drip from his eyes. 
They make dark 
circles on the ground. 
Nature once again finds a way 
to create art, 
where only sorrow is found. 

Blood flows from his wrist
Oozing through a deep slit
He's cut himself once again, 
for someone who's cut herself off from him. 

Cracked is his heart, 
but his soul has not been blackened yet. 
I see it in the way he helps the world deal with its grief, 
never uttering a word about his own strife.

Tremors rack his hands
as he types out her name 
and it appears on the screen. 
I know he wishes he were sending her cheesy texts instead of corporate emails. 

He gets breathless
and a little bit restless. 
Nobody notices, they're buried in their own work. 
And like every time, I push my bottle of water toward him. 

""Remember to stay hydrated"" I say
with a bright smile, 
for there's nothing else that I can do. 
Let him take his own time 
to recuperate. 
All while letting my eyes tell him
that I observe. 
And when he hurts then I hurt. 

Tell me when you're ready to fall in love again, 
I will forever fall in with you. ",love,1553151735,kugelblitzgarf,0,3,True,2019-03-21

471,Is a polyamorous relationship stronger than a monogamous one? Unconditional love?,"Say you’re in a poly/open relationship and you both have the option (but you don’t have to) to have sex with and create romantic connections anyone you want, and you are both okay for each other to do that. Would having the option to be free to explore other relationships as you please, and still have your *true love* accept and love you, make you stronger than a monogamous relationship, where acting on any romantic temptation usually means the end of a relationship. 

If you had complete faith that your partner was THE ONE, should you then let go of any insecurity you have, and let your partner explore sexually if that’s what they want to do, and still know that at the end of the day they choose you as their #1? And visa versa. 

If you can go out and do whatever you want but still have that one person you pick over everyone else, is that a more genuine, stronger love? 

If you truly love somebody should you not prevent them from exploring other romantic interests where they could potentially find a better person that they’re more suited to and happier with, because you want them to yourself? Is that selfish?

I’m not poly but the concept of it is interesting. Monogamy seems like a social construct. I think all long term relationships will experience temptations, but we never act on it because we know it would hurt our partner. 

Is the negative nature of cheating amplified by society? It’s like, once a cheater always a cheater. People are encouraged to leave somebody who cheats on them. Would it not be better to understand why your partner cheated, what led them to do it, and try to correct whatever issue caused it, instead of just leaving them no questions asked? If you truly loved somebody wouldn’t you try to understand them? Everybody makes mistakes but it seems like cheating is the one mistake that you should not forgive.

482,Problems with a girl,"Obligatory Throwaway Account

I had a crush on a girl for about 2 years. 2 painstakingly long years. I was always afraid of doing something as i “knew” she didn't like me like that. Near the end of these two years, my self-esteem was destroyed and I can say for sure that I hated myself. Well, this got worse when one of my closest friends asked her out on a date even though he knew how I felt. This honestly broke me a little, and I still don't know who to trust as it seems friends come and go so fast. Anyway, the girl discovered how I felt and told me she has liked me for over a year now. I can honestly say this was the happiest I've felt in years. 

So there began our relationship. I wanted nothing but her, every moment we spent together was ecstasy. The problems began when both of our personal lives started to turn to shit. I wanted to be with her more from this, but she just wanted to shut everyone out, which I find fair as everyone handles their problems their way. Well, things got worse and she wasn't really been talking to me much for 2 weeks. She told me early on in the relationship that if that happens shes sorry because she can’t control it. Her saying that kept me calm during this time, as I figured she'd be back in no time and I will always be there for her.

She ended up messaging me properly after those 2 weeks saying that she wanted a break, which I'm guessing isn't as much of a break, as an end. My friends know most of the story and tell me there's still a chance, but I can't pull myself to believe this fully. But still, these 2 possibilities are leaving me disgustingly anxious, as I don't know if I should let go of this girl and keep my pride, or lose my pride in trying to find out if there's still a chance. 

I feel like I'm at an all-time low and can't trust anyone, as everybody has either left or I’ve pushed them away.

We have been through so much together, from homecomings to proms to football games to concerts to beach trips to college and more. I never knew that growing up with someone you love could make life so much better. We used to fight a lot a few years ago, especially when he was still maturing and we were still learning each other, but now that we’ve gotten past that stage, nothing could be better. We really made things work and I can’t imagine life without him. When I’m down or upset about anything in life, I always remember I have him. No matter how hard it gets, I know he’s going to stick around. He is the sweetest type of guy on earth, and there is nothing he wouldn’t do for me. His soul is genuine and he doesn’t have a mean bone in his body. He has showed me what love is and for that I am forever grateful. He shows me that love is kindness, sympathy, care, laughter, cuddles, smiles, admiration, the little things, and so much more. Every day I think of a new word to describe love and that’s what it is. Love is a collection of so many other things and that’s why it’s so close to magic. Love is aching to be with someone just to feel their presence. Love is forgetting all the worries of the world to focus on one person. No one can explain exactly what it is, you just have to find it for yourself.

486,Why did he leave after sex?,"So I had started talking to this guy about five months ago, that liked me back in high school. Im now 20 and he's 21. It started out as texting and then we started hanging out. At first I had made it clear that I only wanted to be friends. I really liked him, but my Christian parents did not allow me to date him, because he is an atheist. I am completely undecided  as far as religion goes and still trying to figure things out, but at the time I was just going to school and was completely dependent on my parents financially and had to follow their rules. 

My parents allowed me to hang out with him as long as nothing more happened, but then eventually things escalated to the point where we were making out, so I called it all off in order to make sure that nothing went further than I was comfortable with at the moment, as things were moving very quickly, but mostly because my mother found out and didn't allow me to contact him anymore. I sent him a message and explained everything about my parents and how I wasn't allowed to see him. He texted me two weeks later and says he just misses talking to me so we started talking again secretly over text messages. Before long I am sneaking out and going to see him again until eventually he told me that he loved me and that we should move in together as soon as he started his new job. 

He said that he wanted to help me get out of my parents house, as they are extremely controlling and he hated them for it. He was in the process of getting a new job and said when he got his first paycheck we'd get an apartment together, as I was also starting a new job. He was telling me that he had never met anyone like me and that he didn't want to lose me. eventually I was sending nudes, as we rarely got to see each other and we were sexting and we were even making plans financially and he seemed super sincere. 

He got the job that he had been wanting and we were so happy. The next day I lost my virginity to him and two days later he texts me and says I'm too nice for him and that he doesn't love me anymore. He told me we should both be single and that he was distracting me from nursing school. He also told me that he was a bad guy and that i could do better. 

I asked for a better explanation, but he said, "" listen to me! You can just be a friend I'm at work now!"" Later I told him that I had to block him and wouldn't be able to speak to him again and he said, ""alrighty."". I asked him why he was being so cold and he said it wasn't cool of me to block him. I explained it was because of my parents and he said he was sorry and that he understood. 

That's the last I heard from him. Did he ever love me or did I just get played? Is it possible that he faked a whole 5 month relationship? Could he have lied about everything he said about me? 

or was he for real about his reasons? It was all so sudden and he hasn't spoken to me since, as my parents found out that I was sneaking out and forced me to block him and put a tracker app on my phone so that they know everywhere that I go. I'm so confused. I still love him and he said he wanted friends, but now I can't speak to home at all. 


I want closure, but don't know how to get it. I was honestly turning into a nervous wreck, because of the situation with my parents. All of the lies and lack of freedoms was getting to me and I wasn't okay. I wonder if that is why he left. I feel so embarrassed for opening up to him, as I am usually a shy person.

489,Crush on Family Friend since childhood,"Hi there guys, where to start lol. 

I [27M] have awesome family friends in my life, (my dad's best friends family), we have known each other all our lives, we are very close friends even though we live about 150 miles apart. 

I've had girlfriends come and go and recently I have been going on dates/using tinder. The dates end up going no where  as i  don't feel a spark and to be honest, when I think of a woman I want in my life romantically the beautiful image of the daughter [25F] of my dad's best friend, I've had a crush on her since  can remember comes into my mind so often. 

When I am with her I get a lot of feelings within which nearly burst out of my heart everytime I look into her eyes. Her body language doesn't give the usual signs  that she likes/fancies me though, it's tough because were close friends and i am afraid that if I open up to her she might not feel the same way and it may make things awkward between us and even the rest of her family. I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable and I don't want to lose what I have, just being in her company makes me happier for sure but my heart wants more between us, I see my life with her, a life partner, a soul mate.

What do I do? Any advicee aaaaa!",love,1553245073,Budzi1,0,1,True,2019-03-22

I feel so happy and warm and fuzzy inside and its great, he isn't like any of the other guys I've dated. He respects me, doesn't put any pressure on me, we come up with inside jokes every week, we learn new things about each other everyday despite being really good friends for 2 years before we started dating.

493,I'll never be like her.,"I'll never be her. I know you say I'm better in every way to her, but I know that's simply not true.

Two weeks ago you broke up. The day after your breakup you were almost crying to me about her.. showing my photos of her how pretty and cute she was. Talking about things you loved about her and her flaws. Heck, you have photos which remind you of her flaws. 

Now we're together.. you've stopped bringing her up as much, but I still think about and compare myself to this girl every single day. She was confident...cute...knew what she wanted... she was even partly Russian for god's sake. Isn't there a stereotype that Russian girls are attractive or something?  She was your first kiss. 

Look at me.. I can't do makeup. I wear the same old torn clothes every day. My hair's dry and I have no money to make re-dye it. It's basically yellow now.. I'm ugly. Or at least ugly compared to her with her spotless skin, cute pixie cut, and thin body. 

You were my first kiss. Last weekend. I love you. I love you so so much. But it's been such  a short time since the two of you broke up.. I feel inferior. I know you're still broken over her. Being cheated on doesn't take a week to heal!! You probably compare me to her every time we talk... 

I wish i was her. 

I bet you wish i was her too

But I'm the total opposite.. in literally every way

2,Story of how I fell in love,"It started when I got on my bus almost a year ago and there was a new person, who I never seen or ever knew, (shocker I knew everyone in my school) and so I sat in a different seat since he was in mine, me my brother and my friend didn’t trust him, our bus only had 7 people on it so seeing a knew person on the bus going home even though we were the firsts ones on the bus? It was strange. Anyways we were texting about him and I decided , LETS TALK TO THEM! And so I started talking.

It was awkward at first but then I found out his name was Michael. Whenever I got on the bus after that he’d put his headphones into his bag and we’d talk, morning and afternoon. It wasn’t till 3 weeks later we started hanging out at the school as well. And I started noticing little things about him that was absolutely adorable. We had 2 period (classes) together, and we started hanging out with each other 24/7 and he was my absolute best friend. But I guess I didn’t realize I fell for the dimples that appeared on his cheeks every time he smiled at me? Or the way he had a sparkle in his eyes and it just made my heart warm. We were friends 3+ months before I did something incredibly ballsy, I was with my friend leaving the library and he was coming in and I stole his hat (like usual) and I decided to give him a kiss on his cheek and ran. IT WAS SO EMBARRASSING CAUSE I DIDNT KNOW I WAS DOING IT TILL IT WAS DONE. Anyways, our bond starting growing after that cause he confessed he liked me too, and after a month of that he asked me out.

And that my children is how I fell in love with my Muffin",love,1549125416,donTaTmEChIlD,7,1,True,2019-02-02
3,Tell me about your first loves/teenageloves,"Here is my story

We were teenagers, and we had just started secondary school, so we were about 13-year-olds. We had all the same classes so we were always together.
 We became quite close, quite soon and we talked frequently. It was easy for me to talk to him about anything and it was the same feeling other way around. We always laughed together and he made me feel happy and loved and was there for me even when I felt useless.
We were friends for over a year and I was fine with that because he had a girlfriend. Then.. I have no idea what happened but he was all i thought about. He made me feel loved and happy and just amazing. The way he smiled at me everytime we passed in the hallways or he made a stupid joke just to see me smile, I guess it made me feel special.
He broke up with his girlfriend and we got even closer during the next summer. We ate until we felt sick and laughed until our stomachs ached. We spent many nights together doing (at the time) the most amazing things like went swimming at the middle of the night and  we just had fun for the whole summer. 
You guessed it, it ended. We stayed friends, well I mean you could say we became bestfriends and we loved each other unconditionally through everything. His goal everyday was to make me smile. And just looking at this sparkling green eyes made me feel safe and at home. He knew me better than anyone else. I would cry and he would hold me and say ""you will be fine, I know it. I know you."" 
Another year passed and summer started again. I had a boyfriend and he had a girlfriend, but we still couldn't be apart and we saw eachother almost everyday. He would say stuff like ""I'm not leaving you alone until I know you are fine and that you will go home and eat well and go to sleep after eating."" I loved him and he loved me, and we both knew it, everyone around us knew it. 
It took me a long time to get over him and try to get past what had happened. And for the longest time ever all I could think about everyday was his happy eyes and his concerned voice when i called him crying. His amazingly soft skin and his wonderful laugh. His ways of making me happy and always caring for me. His brown hair and big hands, his humour and sensitivity. It was all just perfect and I still wonder that if things would've gone differently would we still be together?

He pays the up most attention to me, he's understanding. He is himself around me and that is what I truly love! Him! Just him! He's given me confidence, hes mended everything I ever thought was broken about myself. Most of all he's shown me the true meaning of happiness. This is the last time I trust another with my heart.

10,My View of Life and Love," I think everyone feels bad about themselves and deflects that feeling onto the people around them. It's their own pain which stems from their own past life experiences and the ways in which they have learned to associate the wrong feelings with their human interactions. Everyone is searching for love but nobody has wired themselves to love in the correct ways. There is a way of viewing love that is unlike most, naturally you wont fit in if you have it. True radiating love is like a foreign language to the majority of the world. People somehow connect the feelings of pain, fear and hurt with caring for others. When a person is able to journey back and find the root of that connection, then view it through the same lenses of true love, the connection will heal and they win that level of life. Life is a trip and you can go much much higher if you are true to the feelings of yourself and the people around you. ",love,1549167646,unique_user_names,0,1,True,2019-02-02

I haven’t talked lots about Xxxxxx so here goes. 
He’s probably the best thing that’s ever happened to me. He loves me for who I am, encourages me to be anything I want, believes in me wholeheartedly and stands behind my decisions, and lets me be upset when I need to be. He’s always the first to find my logical silver lining. He’s very real and sees things for how they are, but never will suggest I’m wrong. He makes me laugh until I’m going to puke. He’s strong, in an emotional and physical way. He’s good at opening pickle jars and building wardrobes. He makes me feel like a woman - and refers to me that way, never once calling me a girl. Sometimes he calls me his old lady when talking to his work buds. He would do anything to protect me, but would let me stand up for myself in an instant. I never feel pressured or “oppressed”. He loves my independence, but also that there are lots of ways I need him. He doesn’t hesitate to tell me that he needs me equally. He’s an excellent provider, and works hard. He’s never once made me feel guilty for not contributing as much as him, and instead expresses gratitude for all that I do. He treats me like an equal. He’s proud of me, and proud to be with me. He kisses my forehead and holds my hand when we go out. He tells me I’m smart and admires it in me. He’s smart. He listens and he remembers the smallest things. He remembers everything, the things I’ve forgotten I’ve even told him. Every morning I wake up to my favorite coffee cup in front of the pot, with a spoon in it for me, without fail. He locks both doors when he leaves for work, and turns on the heater for me. He clears the snow from my car when he leaves for work at 5.30, and texts me “Drive safe” around 8 when he knows I’m waking up. I’ve never caught him checking out another woman, not because he simply hasn’t been caught but that he simply doesn’t. I’ve never felt second-best. I’ve never felt discarded. He looks me in the eyes when he speaks to me. He’s my best friend. He’s the best thing to ever happen to me. ",love,1549219731,macabrasive,6,1,True,2019-02-03
20,I think I’m in love with my best friend?!?!,"It all started when I joined my colleges rugby team. I think I had a crush on her, we can call her Zoe, when I joined but I wasn’t sure and she had a girlfriend so I wasn’t going to try anything. So a few semesters later, we had our banquet and she wasn’t playing at the time and she broke up with their girlfriend but somebody on the team brought her as a date, just as a friend though. Banquet is always a crazy time. A lot of drinking. Had a lot to drink and ended up in bed with Zoe. After that we started hanging out a little more and we would spoon every now and then, but we never hooked up again at least for a while. So then I left and went overseas for a semester. Came back for summer and that is when things started to pick up. During the summer Zoe and I and our friends went to the bars and just hung out with each other a lot like almost everyday. And most times when we went out Zoe and I would end up in bed again and it just started to become this cycle. We enjoyed hooking up with each other and we enjoyed hanging out with each other. But it has always been weird she has told she can’t date me, so we never tried anything and just kept it casual. BUT whenever we are drunk though we both tell each other how we feel and we both like each other. We even told each other that if we aren’t married by 35 we will marry each other.  Never made it exclusive. BUT then she found somebody at the bars one time and they started hitting it off and then ended up dating each other for 4ish months. When she got into that relationship she would bring her around to parties and stuff and hung out with our friend group and stuff. That is when I realized I was in love with my best friend. I got jealous and uncomfortable when I would see them together. I knew that I had caught feelings for her and I feel for her hard. So they dated and I just cried a lot. BUT they broke up and she came back to me and we started sleeping together again. And now I’m here spending almost everyday with her falling for her and I don’t know what to do. Again, we never became exclusive so she is free to see other people. And that is what she did last night and I don’t know how to handle this to be honest. She hooked up with somebody on the rugby team and now I just am jealous and mad. I have been crying since last night. I love her and I just want her to be mine. I want to tell her that I’m jealous but she is just so fucking annoying. Ugh I love her so much.

There’s no outside, no kids, no work, no bills or schedules.  I can’t remember feeling so full, so complete.  I feel like I’m floating, no pain, no worry, as if my heart has never been broken.  Just pleasure and joy, and I think that all humans should experienced this euphoria.  Yet this fullness comes in a rush and then it’s gone.  I want him and I enjoy him but I can’t take him and he can’t be mine.  Our paths are running at different speeds and in directions that may never meet.  We live in different corners of the state and the distance is real....He told me early on “ don’t cry for me, I won’t cry over you.”  It sounds easy until you start to float, until you kiss him and it happens, the world disappears again.  It can happen, I can be happy again, I can feel bliss and feel empowered.  Keep a wall up, enjoy the ride, have fun, don’t get invested.  PLEASE GOD make it STOP! Just stop and make it go away, the same joy and excitement that was some of the greatest experiences In my life are the same ones that I wish could go away, disappear so I wouldn’t recall them as often as I breathe.  Alfred Lord Tennyson is a piece of shit, My heart didn’t need this, it needed ice and cold and hardening. Why did I open up and let him in when I knew the time was short, that something that wasn’t meant to be, happened...You’re a fool, a sucker, a weak human with a tired heart. Its a constant battle between my heart and my brain, and both are losing.  I spend my days waiting and watching, looking for solace in music lyrics or a poem... and all I can do is hope time can fix what I’ve done.

22,Don't judge.,"My wife in the other room...oblivious that my eyes are filled with tears.  Missing you.  I think about you all the time.  Before I go to bed.  As soon as I wake.  And all night as I dream.  I get nervous when I see you.  Even though I may never have you.  You tell me you feel the same...which only makes it worse.  If only I were crazy about you I could accept that.  But knowing you want me too is torture.  I treasure every moment I get to see you.  Even if it is only for a second.  I wish I only wanted you because you are sexy and beautiful.  But you being smart...and hardworking...and a great mother...and so many other things I find attractive kills me inside.  Your smile means the world to me.  It turns my bad day around.  I try so hard to be a good man.  But it makes no difference.  My heart knows what it wants.  And as much as I try to get you out of my mind, I can't.  I want you.  ",love,1549228788,vvancruz,6,1,True,2019-02-03
23,The only constant is everlasting change ​,"And as a last resort I decided to lean onto love.

to save me and my soul 

from fading into the nothingness that drowns my mind.

And It was beautiful. 

She was beautiful. 

She was something I had never seen before

She was a concocting storm of brilliance and lust

The way she held herself high through everlasting hurricane of emotions that were designed to drag her down

is expressed beautifully by her gifted hands.

My respect for her falls no shorter then the extent of of my love for her 

To ease her mind we get high off of the sadnesses we didn't know we shared

Slowly realizing that we were indeed 

created to accompany each other throughout our journeys in life.

26,who is this boy?,"So, I was out partying with my roommate. I don't remeber exact date but I know that was some friday in October last year. Party was organised for freshmens from my roommate's college but there were many people outside that college (including me). Little after party started I noticed cute boy few tables next to us, he was with his (girl and boy) frineds. But I'm just too shy to take first step so I was just gave up on that and hoped that he would notice me. As night went on, there were more and more people and they got in way between our and his table so I didn't see him anymore, and to be honest I was having somuch fun that I didn't care about some random cute boy at the club, because, like when I'll see him again, I don't know who he is or anything. Days went by and I forgot about him, until one friday I was walking towards bus station I was heading to my dorm and across the road I saw that boy which was soo strange to me, because that was very close to my college (which is one of 3 in that area, but all of them are in same two buildings) so that maybe meant that he is student from one of those three colleges. I tried not to think much about it, but it was so strange to me how it is possible that I saw him again (keep in mind I go to college in pretty big city). But, I told myself that it's just coincidence... But! Again, after one month I saw him again in different location, this time I was walking from PE class with my friend. This location is not close to my college, and this class is optional. At the begging of the term we picked our PE class, we were choosing between (around) 15 activities that are located in different parts of city. So when my friend I were walking from that class we were talking about something and something caught my eye, and as he was passing by us and as we made eye contact I realised who he was, and I was so confused, like how... i don't know is this coindidence or not at this point.  

Fast foward month later, it's 16th of January I'm just exiting from building where I have PE, I'm walking and I see someone walking towards me (thinking, someone is probally just going to class, we can come to PE in period prom 4pm to 6pm) 

That person was that cute boy from club from few months ago that I thought that I will never see him again. As I'm walking by him I automatcly smiled at him and he done same, I just continued to walk because I was so confused what just happened. That there left me with so many questions but so little clues. So, I think we're taking sam PE class, BUT, that same class are taking students (not just freshmans) from al least five more colleges. I don't know all of those collages so I can't really make assumptions, because I never really paid attension where those poeple are from. I only know how he looks which can't help me finding more about him.

So, I'm very confussed because I don't know is it really coincidence that i saw him every month. And I don't know how to find out more about him, and what to do if I see him again? ",love,1549234580,ShyHiSunflower,0,1,True,2019-02-03

28,BEST FRIEND LOVE ADVICE PLEASE,"Ok so...
To put a long story short..
I met this guy a few months ago, we met at the pub through a big group of friends and we hit it off pretty quick. We became friends super quick, we’re different but we click very well and we’ve both helped each other with our problems.

I’ve found myself falling for him, constantly wanting to be his center of attention, wanting him to hold me in his arms and keep me safe. And I’ve wanted him to do the same for me and he has been very good to me. When he hugs me, I get flutters.

However, I have no physical attraction to him. The idea of us sleeping together makes me uncomfortable because I’m not into him physically.
 
I am not a shallow person, and I don’t believe that looks dictate how a relationship can go. However, I do believe that its an important part of being with someone, so not being physically attracted to someone will inevitably cause problems further down the line.

I dont know what to do guys. Do I act on it and potentially encounter difficulties when addressing physical things or do I wait it out?

The problem being, the more I wait it out the more I feel the jealousy consuming me. The more i hate not having my arms around him or talking to him on an emotional level.

Please guys, to anyone thats been in my situation, please help me deal with these feelings because I’m at a loose end.

Thanks in advance 💕

29,A love problem,"So, I am 22, a college student, I was dating a girl for 5 years, was going to propose to her, bought the ring, and a week before I was going to ask, she cheated on me and broke up with me. There's more to it, but that's not what this is about. So it's been almost three months now, still hurts In the back of my heart. But, there is this childhood friend of mine who had a crush on me, she is now a close family friend, like I call her mom my aunt, and she calls my mom her aunt. We used to send love letters and stuff back before phones were big. I have always wanted to be with her, but the girl from before asked me out first, and honestly I thought I was going to be with her for a long time, I feel I neglected my friend with school and my ex girlfriend and sports. My ex was my first and only girlfriend in my life so far, so I just am unsure what to do. I dont know if she still cares for me like that anymore, and I dont want her to feel like a rebound, because I have always had genuine feelings for her, just life happened. I really do want to take my time and heal to not bring past feelings into a new relationship, so I am not pursuing just any relationship, but a real connection. So what I am struggling to understand is if I should pursue her or not? Would I be an ass if I finally decided to answer her feelings this late.",love,1549241407,jamesonferguson,0,1,True,2019-02-03

34,My S/O plays video games and texts me at the same time. I feel bad,"Before I start this I will have to add that I naturally feel bad, about everything. I say sorry way too much but I can’t help it.

My boyfriend enjoys playing video games, he’ll play them for a good 3-5 hours depending. Every single time he always makes sure to text me back whether it be right away or 5-15 minutes, sometimes longer depending on the game I guess.

So I asked him, how do you manage to text me and play video games at the same time? He said it isn’t easy but it’s manageable. I told him to focus on the game and have fun. What he said next just was so sweet (i mean at least to me, it made me feel really important) 

“You’re more important than any video game”

Now I do feel bad about this. He’s texting me while playing video games, when before he was dating me he played with little to no interruptions. I feel like an interruption and like in the way. 

Now I did express this to him and he said it was fine, nothing to worry about and again repeated that talking to me is more important.

I’m so grateful and happy he would do both and thinks of me as more important but i’ve tried texting and playing video games at the same time. So it just makes me feel a little bad because we often have full conversations.

However I’m still very grateful and love talking to him, don’t get me wrong.

We were something between FWBs and a relationship in October. I did not like it and I found out he had another FWB at the time, so I wished him all the best and said I'm not going to call or text him anymore.

Now here's the thing.
He almost never likes anyones instagram posts. 
However, on 8th December he liked my post from April. 
I thought it was somehow an accident and decided to ignore it.
But then, one month later, on 14th January 2019. he liked my post from September. 
There's no way he could accidentally do that- 2 times.
But he's not texting me.
What is this supposed to mean? What is he trying to achieve with this crap?
I still have feelings for him, so I decided that if he likes another of my pictures, I'm just going to like one of his posts and leave it at that until he texts me (if he ever does).

38,"Eat, Pray and Love in Armenia"," ***Kudos to you, if you caught the title reference of the famous book and the movie!***

So, what does it really mean to eat, pray and love in Armenia?  

As a country proudly serving all kinds of delicious food, Armenia has a lot to offer for every taste. As the first nation to adopt Christianity as our official religion, it should also not come in as a surprise that the country has countless ancient churches that both visitors and locals admire. 

Let’s go through each of these segments one by one. 

## What food should you try in Armenia? 

Armenian cuisine is very diverse - some of the food is similar to the Middle Eastern dishes you may have had, some of it comes from the Soviet times, and some of it is still very unique and different from what you have ever seen.  

If you like dishes with meat - try **dolma**. It is grape leaves or cabbage stuffed with meat, herbs and rice. If you visit in summertime, it is also common to use eggplants, tomatoes and other vegetables to stuff with meat. You can also find the vegetarian alternative with groats called **pasuts dolma**. 

If you are into bread and dough (who isn’t?!) - try **lavash**. It is a thin flatbread that you’ll see on the table for every meal of the day. The bread is traditionally prepared in tonir, an underground cylindrical clay oven that is used for cooking. A lot of times people prefer eating lavash with their meals, with cheese, or even just by itself. 

Looking for something new to drink? Have some tan! This simple drink is made of yogurt (Armenian word is **matsoun**) and water, added with some salt and herbs for every taste. To cool off the summer heat, sometimes people also add cucumber to their tan. Be aware though - Armenian yogurt is more sour, so the taste may be strange for you (strange but delicious!). 

## Churches - discover the spirituality of Armenia

Armenians are the first nation to have adopted Christianity as an official religion. So, it should not come as a surprise that the country has countless churches in every corner. In general, you should feel the spirituality and history preserved in the churches you visit. 

*Here are some of the places you should definitely pay a visit while in the country.* 

If you are spending some time in Yerevan, be sure to visit **Saint Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral** located in the city center. Compared to other churches that have been built centuries ago, this cathedral is fairly new (constructed in 2001). However, that doesn’t make it any less valuable. It is considered to be the largest cathedral in the Armenian Apostolic Church not just in the country but in the world. 

With a beautiful view of Mountain Ararat as your companion, do also visit one of the most ancient monasteries called **Khor Virap**. Located in Ararat region, it is said that for 13 years Gregory the Illuminator was imprisoned in this monastery by King Tiridates III.

After curing Tiridates’ illness, Saint Gregory eventually became the king’s spiritual mentor and Armenia adopted Christianity as its official religion in the year 301. Be sure to take the stairs and go through the long way to the underground and see where Saint Gregory was kept for so many years. 

Despite being a small country, the nature in Armenia is drastically different in each region. When you visit Vayots Dzor, check out **Noravank monastery**, that is located in the narrow gorge, in the middle of big beautiful rocks that make your experience even more special.

Built in the 13th century, the complex includes chapels and is most famous for its two-storey church of **Surb Astvatsatsin**. To go to the second floor, you can take (or rather climb) through some of the mostnarrow stairs you can imagine. 

## What's love got to do with it? 

The last but most important segment to get to know Armenia and Armenians is through its **warm hearted people**. The country is famous for its exceptional hospitability and people will definitely invite you over to their house anywhere you visit.

If you are ever a guest at an Armenian house and you have only known them for several minutes, don’t be surprised if they instantly start throwing a fabulous dinner table made from the organic food they grow in their yards and tell you about their region over a glass of local brandy.

Armenians truly love their homeland and that love is contagious to others who visit the country and listen to their stories.

39,What did I do to deserve someone to love me so much?,"What did I do to deserve someone to fight for me so hard? 

To have someone pray for the best for me all the while forgetting and no regard for herself and her well being. 

To pray for my health, love, peace, happiness, and successes before her own..

I don’t deserve a love like that. Especially of how I have ended the relationship and how I just had no idea of the pain she’s been enduring. But just now realizing that I’m the root cause of that pain. 
Is it my fault that I was the root cause of that love? I know I’m not at all at fault for someone’s codependency; that I am the root cause of all of someone’s happiness and pain. But that doesn’t soften the blow of the heart.

I was in high school walking from one class to another then i stopped for a sec and looked across the to the next balcony (i forgot to say my school has 2 floors). Then i turn my head to see this girl staring back at me, i felt my heart filled with a warm feeling. I stared deep into her grey eyes and saw from her face and eyes expression that she felt it too. Boy!!!! I was confused as hell until i got back from school that i collected my thoughts and came to the conclusion that i fell in love. For the next 2 and a half years we just glance at each other catching each other's eyes not smiling. She made 2 attempts to make first talk but i was dense until it was too late. I FUCKIN CURSE MY SELF for not saying anything or even smiling at her, for one of yall sayin why didn't i approach her was because i was shy and had low self esteem. We even run into each other outside of school once in Walmart and in chruch and one at a party we lived 7 miles from each other coincidence I THINK NOT Once in summer school we were in the same class ALONE with each other but neither of us said a word.

43,My Friend's Love Relationship.,"Hello everyone. So, this is my friend's love relationship story. I am her close friend, and she is always asking my opinion regarding her relationship. I am so bad in stuff like this thus explaining why I am still single. That is why I need your help in this thread. Therefore, let the story begins.

My close friend's name is Hailey and Hailey has a best friend name, Aila. Back then, Aila has an interest toward a boy named Adam and Adam has a close friend as well, named Liam. Long story short, Aila wanted to know more about Adam. So, she asked Hailey to make friend with Liam to know Adam well from Liam. As time passed by, Hailey attached to Liam. Liam is a guy who just experienced a break up with his girlfriend named Nia at that time. Therefore, one day, Liam called Hailey and told her about his girlfriend and why he broke up with her etc. etc. If I am not mistaken, during that call, Liam said that he wanted to know more about Hailey and wanted both of them always to support each other. I am afraid this can lead to a rebound relationship as Liam just experienced a broke up with his girlfriend. Hailey has such a soft heart. She knew she is in love with Liam, but she knew she had to go so that Liam can get back with Nia. Hailey once told me that Liam really loves Nia. Due to that, Hailey sends a long message to Liam stating that she has a feeling called love toward him, but she denied it so Liam can get back with his ex-girlfriend Nia. I will put the long message below.

**Hailey message**

Hello Liam,

&amp;#x200B;

I believe you must be sleeping right now. I think this is a good time for it. Did you notice that I look quite weird lately? Sometimes, I am mad or not replying to your message and stuff. Let me be honest tonight.

&amp;#x200B;

We start our stupid friendship with a fight. The first thing that came to my mind during that time was I want to know you and only befriend. Since you are rude at that time and I have like a ton of patience, we still are friends till now. It is like we did not have any awkward feelings toward each other and we linked together without we noticed it.

&amp;#x200B;

And as time passed by, we are getting closer, and I feel comfortable, but at the same time, I am scared. I was scared that I would fall in love with you. If you still remember our last call, you told me about your ex-gf. I was silent at that time because of the thoughts that I have which were you are so sincere in loving Nia, and I felt I didn’t have any chance to know you more in-depth. There was a time when I tried to ignore you too, but I failed.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep reading please,

And now, I have decided that I have to go to not let these feelings toward you develop more than it should and to not giving you a hard time in entertaining me. Don't mind me. This is my problem. To fall in love with you.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe you will say why we can't just be only friend? I would love to but I did not want to break my heart. It is the same situation as yours where you love Nia so much, but you know you can't win her heart back. This is the situation that I am in right now. Therefore, I advise you to go for Nia. Don't let her go. I saw your sincereness in loving her, and your love towards her is not fading even a bit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will always pray for you from far. I am sorry. Before anything else, I want to be honest. I have extremely low blood pressure, and I once had an operation to get rid of my appendix. During the operation, I lost a lot of blood. Due to that, I am having problems that I am facing now.

&amp;#x200B;

Please take care. Promise with me. Find Nia and fight for your love, ambition and happiness. 😍

&amp;#x200B;

I will always smile and happy for you from far. 😍

&amp;#x200B;

Much love, 

Hailey

44,I think I’m going to marry her! I feel like life is almost too perfect,"Me and my girlfriend are coming up to 3 years of being together. In that short time, she lost her job 3 times, my fathers health fell so bad I thought I was going to lose him,we were in bad debt and in the short time we have been together, payed it off and are living an amazing life. We adopted a dog together (a perfect pug) and now are way more financially stable. 

Right before I met her, I visited California for the first time. I had been out of a really big relationship and was truly heart broken. California changed me and I grew up quite a bit from that small week vacation of couch surfing with my tech pay. Now life is very different and in 2019 we are going back. We have been talking about marriage for a wile but unlike a lot of people, we’re both really exited to me married to each other. I think with all the challenges, adversity’s and wins we had it’s gong to be perfect. I love her with all of my heart and want her to have my children and also think she’s the most attractive woman there is (even though we have a celebrity sex list)

This trip is when I am gong to make the next step in the relationship. I love her so much that I want to prepose to her on a beautiful beach with an amazing ring. I was thinking that I would make it’s an emerald engagement ring because of 1. My Irish background 2. My green eyes of the same color.

I came to r/love to figure out if this is what making it in love feels like. Right now I just feel like everything is perfect. Should I worry for the next big disaster? ",love,1549272572,RedditRobinHoodOG,1,1,True,2019-02-04

46,Growing Confidence Back,"Once there was a nerdy guy who, after his first break up when he was almost 17, became a carefree dude. He started dating many girls, he used to go to parties and make out with girls he didn't even get to know their names; and, as he already had his first time before, he used to have intercourse with a certain number of girls.
After going through a little depression he stopped seeing people, then he started hanging out with a girl from High school He met three times. In a few weeks they started a relationship, he tried to be a nice mature guy as he turned 19, but he knew a younger girl. A younger, more beautiful and with a body he liked better.
The nerdy guy unexpectedly was dating two girls at the same time. Unbelievable. He claimed it was horrible in a satisfactory way, always complaining about how hard it was. Eventually he broke up with the first girl, a girl who loved him for what he was; and started a relationship with the younger girl, a girl he knew on Facebook because they had a mutual friend and because they liked the same stuff.
Were they perfect together? Well, her first boyfriend was him. He said he wanted to settle down in that moment and claimed to be madly in love with her. Their hearts were way in different places and they never got to know each other that well. They broke up and he got that depressed he wanted to be dead. 
He started working and met a girl there he thought was cute but never wanted to actually try a thing until she started being very nice and kinda flirty with him. He was confused; he tried to guess if she wanted to have a relationship with him or not. Still they never talked about them being in a relationship even though everyone at work was always joking about it.
When he got over his last ex-girlfriend met some other girls, but he felt different, as if he had a talent he lost. But talked to his colleague and agreed on being friends, she said he's a smart, interesting and good-looking guy. He started seeing his colleague as a very good and supporting friend. But still don't know how to bring up a date/relationship topic.
He's going to college this year, he lost years of his life caused by booze, being terrible to girls and not being organized, he's turning 21. He expects to meet even more people in college and enforce other social relationships.
He's growing confidence back.

54,My Love Story," 

**My Love Story**

It all started at the end of November. I was in class and I was talking to a friend and we were going through her instagram followers for fun. While scrolling we were laughing and just making jokes but then I stopped scrolling. I saw the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. She was so fucking beautiful, her hair, her eyes and her lips were just perfect. When I saw her I directly asked my friend who she was. She told me her name and I immediately told her to give me her snapchat. I convinced my friend to meet with her as they had not met in a  while and weren’t that close. I waited and waited and finally on the 20th of December I got them to meet. It was a month later. They met and somehow she told her about me and that I wanted to talk to her and get to know her. I was super happy. They went on a second so called friend “date” because they had so much fun on the first. They talked more about me and then I finally added her on snapchat and she accepted me request. We started talking and were having fun. We were bonding and we were seeing we had a lot in common. It was the 30th of December that I told myself that I would rather have her or die. I wrote a message that I would send her in a month, the message said this: “I am writing this on the 30th of december at 2AM and I am thinking about you. You are perfect. I love you so much. You have such a great personality and you are super funny and I can have so much fun while talking to you. When you text me or I think about you I get a feeling that I have never had before. You are the perfect girl. When I think of you all my weaknesses and all the pain goes away. I will always protect you from anyone and I will never let anyone hurt you. Before I saw you my heart was broken by someone I thought loved me, someone I loved more than anything in the whole universe. I was wrong. The person cheated on me and I thought that love was something that never existed, a myth, a joke. I was sad and mad at myself and at everyone. It killed me, I was someone else. You changed me, you flipped a switch inside me that I thought was impossible to be switched. I love you to death and that means even being stabbed 100 times if it meant to protect you. I love you more than you imagine. I love you” This message was something else, it goes on for so much more and I can’t even write it. It was a mad text, it blows up anything. I was in shock myself. I couldn't believe I wrote that. I had patience and I waited and waited until finally I told her how I felt. I was prepared to get rejected. I told her how I felt but did not send her that message because I knew it was too hard to read. I told her and she was surprised and she said that it had nothing to do with me and that she made a promise to herself that she wouldn’t do a relationship and she was focusing on school. I told her I wrote a message about her. She was flattered and she said she wanted to read it. I sent it. She was in shock, she said this, and I quote: “Please don’t tell me you wrote this for me” i said yes i did and sweared on my life. She didn’t respond because it was 1AM.She texted me today saying Hey, and I said Hi back. I told her I was sorry and that I put too much pressure on her but that how I felt. I said I never want her to be sad and said I'm sorry again. She said that that was the most beautiful message someone had ever sent her but she sadly rejected me. Never give up, never, never stop loving. It is ok not to be ok, but it's not ok not to talk about it. LOVE E.Z",love,1549302684,Lover1234Anonymous,0,1,True,2019-02-04
55,I want her back,"I dated this girl for about 3 weeks, but I really like her, and I believe that she likes me back. About 3 weeks ago, she started to freak out, and started to stop talking to me and stoped going out at all. She eventually told me that was having some personal problems, an ex-boyfriend arrasing her and the recent death of her beloved grandmother, and she asked me to be alone, she needed space, I didn´t go very well with that because she didn´t want my suport, so I said that was better to break up while she was needing space. 

I regreted that, and tried to speak to her that days, and she just ignored me, so I gave her complet space, and has been two weeks since we last spoke or seen each other, and I miss her a lot, we only been together for a few weeks, but she is realy special and I want to fix this. The problem is that I´m not very good at this, and don´t want to seem needy, should I risk and wait for her to speak to me, or should I grow some balls and go to her? 

I was thinking about sending her a text about some trivial, like a movie I liked that remebered her or something like that, but I am afraid that is too soon....

56,Idea for opening on the romance i wish would happen with a lady friend i want to be with,"There was nothing I would rather have done in that moment. Finally I had achieved my destiny, the woman of my dreams was in my arms. 
I had spent over a year on the sidelines watching her. She was one hundred percent out of my league for sure. She was also taken by a man who was much better faster cooler and smarter than I.
 For some reason I had convinced her to be my friend.  A casual acquaintance that over time grew. We met through a dead end job we both had. She was in fact a supervisor of mine, and that complicated my feelings for her even more. Now, though many months of sweet talk, favors, and undeniable effort on my part, and some fortunate lovers neglect from her man, she was mine.

57,An open letter to the woman I once loved,"Hello my dear, do you remember me? The way we felt, the love that we shared, or perhaps the conversations we held? I remember them all. I can recall when I first laid eyes on you and realised you were everything that I ever wanted. We went to school together, but I never really noticed you until you began working in the coffee shop right next to me; maybe it was your consuming gaze, or your flawless smile  that finally caught my attention, but it was your capacity for love and empathy that hooked me in. Never in my life have I ever met someone whose outlook on life so matched my own and unfortunately you set the bar so high for all of those I’ve met after you. I’m not searching for perfection, or even someone who resembles you, now I’m merely looking for someone who makes me feel the way that you did. Not once have I met a person that could make me feel those same emotions. Perhaps it was the fact that I’ve always settled in most relationships; I never really chose who I got to be with, they always chose me. You were the first woman I ever engaged of my own will. You were the first I worked so tirelessly to keep in my life. I suppose that’s where I messed up.. I was fully prepared to give up everything to be with you and only you. I allowed myself to become susceptible to the agony of heart break by letting you into my life, fully knowing the power that you held over me. And oh did it break me.. two years almost three now have passed and every time I drink now I remember you. I don’t ask nor do I want to, but it just happens. The passage of time has yet to heal my still wounded heart. Honestly what hurts the most is the fact that I felt so strongly and so deeply toward you that I truly believed you felt the same, but perhaps I was just blinded by passion. I’m sorry that I didn’t see that you had different ideas for the future. I’m not mad at you, in fact I’d really like to thank you. You made me realise that I should never settle just to not be alone. There will always be someone out there worth waiting for, but sometimes you have to be patient to find them. I’m not sure how much longer I’ll have to wait to find another that makes me feel valuable and accepts me in all that I am, but I do know now that my life and my personality has value that someone out there will cherish and bask in, as I will do for them. Thank you for breaking my heart so tremendously that it put me on a path to self discovery. There is nothing more valuable or precious than one’s own self worth, for it is what keeps us going. Though I wish we could have became something more, I’m aware of the important lessons and experience that you gave me. You’ll always have a special place in my heart, but now I’m searching for someone else who will accept me just as you did. Never change yourself for anyone.

after a month and a half of talking she's completely changed the way she talks to me... etc 
I started to see her all the time with a classmate having fun together...

I asked her "" why did you changed is there something's wrong?? I did something's wrong ?? "" 

""I always saw you with that boy (classmate) why you talk to him much than I.."" she told me that there is nothing between me and him... ""

After a week I told her that I'm in Love with you She is the first girl that I truly loved... 

Then she told me ""I can't be the girl you wanted me to be..."" what a sad moment for me ...

Whenever I saw her with that boy I get upset and jealous.. I can't forget her because I see her every day and every hour it's a difficult situation

Bro I love my boyfriend so much I don't think this should be possible. He is so sweet and gentle and altruistic and caring. We've had a rough break, but we are actually willing to work out our issues and talk about things that bother us instead of giving up on each other. We're actually both working on going to therapy to sort out our issues so we don't hurt each other anymore. When I was in Greece in November, there was this one time that I had a GARBAGE mental breakdown, right?  I felt absolutely wack and horrible about myself. I was confused on my sexuality, my feelings and everything bad that had been happening. I decided to go to bed. When I woke up, I had over 250 texts from him with sweet nothings. He stayed up until 3 AM (time here) so he could text me good morning and make sure I felt better for the day ahead. He's stayed up with me when I've been incapable of sleeping. He's hand-written me letters and put so much thought into anything he gives me. He's taken me, carried me bridal-style in front of a mirror, and listed of reasons as to why I should love myself. He is such a smart-ass, too. There isn't a thing about this boy that I don't love. For my birthday, I joked about how I would marry the man that got me a fire opal ring around him. He gave me an opal necklace and sheepishly said ""I hope this works, instead..."". There is so much other stuff I could say about him. It's crazy. He's never ceased to amaze me. Despite his flaws and some incongruities in his behavior in the past, I could really see myself working towards a life full of happiness with him. He's so sweet and gentle and respectful of me. He's put his trust in me even when my past should have given him every reason not to. He accepts me for who I am and is capable of seeing that I matured from the grave mistakes I've made. I love him so much and all I want to do is see my chicken nugget thrive and be successful. It would be oh-so-wonderful if he and I could achieve whatever we wanted to in life alongside each other. We have so many precious memories together, like the time I choked on Carmex while giving him head, and staying up all night to count the stars. We've been there for each other at our completely lowest points, and I just want to be there for his best points and I want to see him blossom into a gentleman/such a fine man. He means so much to me. I don't think I will meet anyone that makes my heart feel as mushy and warm as it does around him. He makes me feel so safe. He feels like my home. He's like a pillow fort or a tent made out of blankets and bed sheets too though, you know? Absolutely everything I think I could want in a partner. Chances are, he won't see this, but if he does...I love you, Jakey. ",love,1549317069,reddithandle_,2,1,True,2019-02-04

I got pregnant with his child when I was 18, he didn’t believe it was his but never wanted to pay out of pocket for a dna test. The last 6 years he’s been in and out of our child’s life. A couple of years ago he decided it was finally time that we worked things out, we were so in love I thought he was a changed man but I thought wrong. This BOY didn’t want to grow with me, didn’t want to move, he just wanted to trap me so no one else would be able to have me. He got abusive, physically and emotionally. He would bring out my past and used that to hurt me, he forced me to marry him and after 8 months of marriage he hurt me really bad and I finally called the police and got out of it. It’s been 6 months since we’ve separated and we agreed to file for divorce jointly but now he’s being an asshole about it all. NOW the boyfriend, he’s been away and when we met it was strictly verbal, we spoke for 2 months before anything happened. We got to know each other in a different level, this MAN wants to have kids, move away, just start all over again. We agreed to leave our past in the past. He calls me every morning and night, my family likes him (the first guy they approve of) MY SON LIKES HIM, which is what’s most important.

76,What I wrote to my girlfriend tonight in response to her being incredibly cold towards me for the last week and emotionally shut down in general.,"What can I give you? all I have to offer is what I am. At any given point all the decisions of my life led me to be who I am in this moment. There is no other moment, and there is no other me. There's ego and id which exists to allow us to identify with a thought and assume that as our facade until it no longer suits the essence of the moment. But we exist externally to that, it's a trick we all play on ourselves every day. But I believe it's not who we are. It's looking glass, sometimes a kaleidoscope, that can magnify/replicate a particular aspect we are finding resonates with our undeniably limited perspective of an constant immeasurable influx of phenomena which ultimately exists as static. We define significance for ourselves. And while this may not make much sense to you initially, think on it. It's everything I have to offer.

If you choose to be in love with me then engage in every part of that chaotic maelstrom and find the beautiful design in it. Ride the solar winds you fuckin nerd. And know none of that is a quote from someone else, those are just my own words of self-reflection.

You can't hide from me because I'll ~never~ stop looking deeper and eventually I always find what I want to see or learn that what I'm seeing is what I need to find because it let's me define my reality, and without the mirrors of humanity casting back those reflections and letting me decide what they mean everything would appear as objectively meaningless as it objectively is.

Rather dreary when you think about it, so choose to see the meticulous craftsmanship prevalent in every facet of your life, right?

It was made happen, for a reason.  


or  


I guess I was supposed to learn a particular lesson.'  


I don't think, in any way, that these things were 'made to happen'.  


What I do believe, is that whatever happens.  


If I seek the wisdom to do what is best, and the willingness to do it;  


If I seek to find a purpose in what I'm going through, to learn from what's happening.  


If I endeavour to carry a message of what I've learned - through words or actions  


then I am made better than I was, better than if the calamity never happened, and I'll gain great things that I would never have otherwise.

I love that I am surrounded by people wiser than I.

82,Instantly I knew he would matter in my life,"Once a hopeless romantic, I (37/F) found myself losing hope that I’d ever find someone who would genuinely love me. I’m not unattractive, unintelligent or otherwise in need of support or validation from someone else so I resigned myself to a belief that perhaps unconditional love was nothing more than a societal construct given as a label for our innate desire to belong and chose to focus on my needs. Daring resulted in superficial layer first meetings but I always found a reason to bail... then I met him (38/M). I can recall the exact moment, riding down the road in his truck, that I looked at him and knew he was it (“the one”). It doesn’t matter how much I tell myself to stay grounded and rational, I can’t stop myself from falling instantly and completely in love with him. All the other guys, despite their attractiveness, wealth and status, can’t even compare to him. He’s not at all what I thought I wanted... he’s more.

83,I cant find someone better than my ex-bf,"Idk what to say..i just need help. My friends tell me to not get back with him but the good stuff that he did to me were much more than the bad stuff he did to me. 

He literally helped me get over my self esteem issues (even though not completely but he did make a very major difference). He loved me. He gave me the attention i needed. He gave me the love i needed. He gave me the friendship that i was looking for. He used to be my everything and the reason of everything that i ever used to do. 

However i caught him texting some girl that i dont know of. He started slowly ignoring me because of something that i didnt want to share with him. And..we just broke up.

What do i do.

84,Everyday with you was never a waste and I will always love you,"5 years ago I met you on twitter. I was going through a hard time of my ex fiance cheating on me and you were there when nobody else was. You helped pick me up and have been my best friend since. Soon after you said you liked me and opened your heart to me and I was terrified of losing you so I said no. And ever since I have been chasing you. 3 years later you agreed to date me and those were the best 3 months of my life. Even though we are thousands of miles apart everyday we still talk. You know how I feel about you and I feel you want the same, but you say you just need someone physically with you and I understand. But every single day it hurts more than I have ever been in pain. Those days i get to see you smile because I made you happy are the days that keep me going. I hope one day we can be truly together and everything will be bliss.

85,"What ""i promise"" means to a cancer","I've shown you my ego in its entirety. I've proven I'm able to hear you when I get stuck in my ego, most of the time. I'm not mean to you and I don't speak to you from a place of mean. I'm patient and loyal. I'm faithful and understanding. I'm open and giving always trying to get better at details. Details is my worst subject and I do my best to grow that part of me. I think constantly and I told you how to pull me out. I took that leap of faith and give my ""true"" self to you. I submitted knowing you have no experience in unconditional. I didn't choose to love you this way. The flow of our connection brought me to the best version of myself. I was completely unaware I could love you with the purists intention, like I do today. I asked you a long time ago if you would take your mask off and let me meet the “real” you. You said yes with hesitation but you did it. We agreed to build on a foundation of friendship,truth,trust and love. We discovered our paths were no accident and or journey together began. We had finally found “us” in what seemed to be a fleeting fairytale we both had almost given up on. We quickly discovered we both had work to do. Our pasts were full of survival skills we flawlessly mastered. We had no idea who we were becoming together. We both knew our foundation would not crack so we had no fear and allowed ourselves to feel knowing the other be right there. True friends is an elusive find that many will never experience. I am in love with my best friend and for awhile I called that a gift. It's more than a gift to make that claim. It's a testament to the courage inside yourself to allow someone to hear the inner dialogue. It's submitting to the what ifs and letting go of things once needed that never allowed love in. I have been with you for three short years and I'm not surviving anymore. I have found home in us and that is what I consider the gift you gave to me. Thank you for believing in yourself enough to take the mask off years ago. It took courage and you will forever be my ALPHA. I love you

Yesterday he replied to my story but just asking for a title song, no more conversation. I feel like it was just out of curiosity idk... i have no idea what to do. I feel so heart broken because i’ve been thinking so much about him, but i feel like randomly texting him „hi how are you” without context is just bad also i dont want to look desperate.

91,For her,"The difference between something you want and something you love can be illustrated by how you treat a flower.
When you want something you'll take it for yourself and then that flower exist as an extension of you.
Its beauty measured by how beautiful you'll allow it to be.
We often feel the need to have possession over the things we love.

But when you love something you discover an appreciation for everything it is.
Knowing something so beautiful, so vast, could never belong only to you.
Seeing its light knowing it would be selfish to hold it hostage from the world.

I pity those who have not gotten the chance to experience you.

And at the beginning of this love I only wanted you for myself.
I am now learning to love you.
I am learning to adore you from three steps back wanting only to experience this life with you, I will not interrupt the path you have forged for yourself 
I will stand beside you, championing your growth.
I will not demand that you change for me.
I only ask that you change for the better.

I want to see you grow as I stand alongside you.
As humans we are so complex, there is an immense depth to our minds and our souls how selfish would it be for me to think I could be everything for you.

So instead, ill be everything I am,
Letting you be everything you are,

92,"The affair I did NOT have that ruined my sex life, then saved it","
This is going to be a bit lengthy (that's what he said) so strap in (or on).

Background. I'm m(34) and my wife is 36. We've been together 14y and married for 5. I love her completely and she is my best friend. We have twin boys who are 2 years old.

I always thought our sex life was good. My wife was always satisfied (she squirts) and the only downside was how many towels we got through. Shortly after we married, my boss's friend who was a recently divorced woman in her early 40s started working at my firm. She spent the first few weeks in my department, she was quite flirty, which I didn't reciprocate. She would tell me of her recent nights out with my boss (who I saw a different side of once this woman started at the firm) and would often invite me out (which I refused). She would tell us of her one night stands and how she needed to 'make up for lost time' she was an attractive woman and didn't lack confidence so she was never short of offers. I did quite like her, she had gorgeous hair and was from Scotland, an accent I adore listening to. She always dressed in suitable office attire but with tight fitting skirts and blouses.

One day I was changing a lightbulb and while I was up the ladder she grabbed my bum. I was surprised as I wasn't really used to female attention but I didn't say anything, hoping my reaction would be enough to stop any more attention. Nope.

A few days later I received a text message from her. She said she hoped I wouldn't mind but my boss gave my number to her. I wasn't happy about this and told her she could only contact me about work related issues. Within a few days she was texting me pictures of her in lingerie and some really dirty messages telling me what she wanted to do to me.

The Monday at work I went straight to my boss's office and told her everything. She said she knew what had happened as she was with her at the time. I asked my boss to stop this all as I wasn't interested. I love my wife and I didn't want her to find the messages and jump to conclusions. The messages did stop.

A few weeks later it was the office Xmas party. My boss and her friend both came dressed really provocatively. They were both quite drunk before the party started and I largely avoided them. As the night wore on I noticed that they were both really drunk and loud. They were texting me all sorts of filthy things they wanted to do to me and things they wanted me to do to them. Offering me a threescore and both had sent me pictures or their breasts and genitals. I decided to leave and went to the toilet before going, they followed me in and pushed me into a cubicle and tried to undress me while kissing me . A colleague came in and caught us (he knew what had happened) and resuced me.

The problem was, I was really turned on by this. I would never cheat on my wife, but I couldn't get them out of my mind. Sex with my wife became difficult. She is not bad in bed but not adventurous at all. Our sex is very loving rather than kinky. After this incident I found it difficult to get and maintain an erection and even orgasm with my wife.

It took 2 years for me to stop thinking about my boss and her friend whenever things got hot in the bedroom. I thought I was missing out on something, but now I realise that those women were the ones missing out. They were missing out on the love I have with my wife.",love,1549400759,_welshchris,7,1,True,2019-02-05
93,Waited all of my life to feel like this,"I (35 F) Rachel have had a rough time with relationships. I was in 2 previous bad relationships and one lasted around 7 years and the second around 9 years. These are the only real relationships that I have had and I stayed in the second one so long because I felt like if it failed then it was my fault. I thought it was normal to have the person that I was with not really be that into me. I had emotional abuse in both and physical abuse in the last relationship. I had gotten help with myself seeing a psychologist that  helped me see things a little different and I started to repair myself. I started to make friends again and I was still unsure of how I was supposed to be treated but I wasn't looking to get involved with anyone. I am naturally bubbly and flirtatious but I never take anything seriously until now.

I was talking with my friends every day and then I met this (28 M) Alex through my group of friends. He was childhood friends with some of the people I knew and we hung out in voice chats and talked a lot. Alex was flirty with me and I just had fun with it but didn't take it seriously. I opened up about my life and my current situation which isn't ideal for being in a relationship. He was just kind and I couldn't help thinking about him. His dad had to have surgery and I was there for him as much as I could be from so far away. His dad passed away and I was wanting to be there to support him. He texted me one day that he loved me, and I didn't say it back I said that i had strong feelings too. I was kind of scared of the age difference, but now that I think about it, it just seems silly to brush off something that i feel so strongly over a number. I thought about it and a few days later it took me a good bit to get the courage but I said it to him over the phone right before he got on a plane to go home.

I wanted to meet him in person mind you we did the video chatting thing etc. I brought it up that maybe it was crazy to ask him to come see me after hes only known me for a few months. He took me seriously instead of brushing me off. We managed to get 2 days set aside for him to fly over to see me. Man, was i nervous. I had all of these thoughts about how i wasn't pretty or good enough etc. I was looking down at my phone when I was waiting for him, he flew all the way across the country to see me.

He walked up to me asking me for a hug and it was the first time I really got a good look into his bright blue eyes. I hugged him and we walked together to get his bag. I noticed he kept glancing over and looking at me while we were walking together and he stood by me I was still wondering if he was interested. It seemed like he was but I just couldn't believe that someone that I was into would like me back. We sat in the car and he leaned over and kissed me and said he couldn't help himself. I blush really easily and he expressed how adorable he thought that it was. I was driving and he couldn't help but look over and touch my shoulder etc. We spent all weekend together and it probably was the best time I had ever had. I took him to the airport and he didn't really say a long goodbye and wanted to be through the airport security super early I was a little thrown off.

I got a text talking about how he was terrible with goodbyes and he would just want to stay if he wouldn't have left then. He went back to work as soon as he got back doing some really long shifts. We didn't text much for a few weeks (not even a hi for like 4 days) and I had started to think that maybe I had been a one night stand type of deal. We finally got to talk again and we started talking more about what we wanted. He was scared I was going to treat it as a one night stand too. He wants to support my goals in any way that he can. He knows that I am physically fragile and he was so understanding and patient with everything. He is even saying that he would like to try living together to see how we would work out. 

I know I have only known him for a few months, but I feel like I can tell him anything and he won't judge me or look down on me. I have had years of marriage that doesn't touch how i feel about him right now. I picture a life and a family but I can't picture that without Alex there with me. We have a balance and support each other when we need it the most. I am in love and I will tell him that every day. 

&amp;#x200B;

99,"The man from Mexico I met once, who has loved me for 4 years","I can not quite believe that this is a story I can even tell, it is like something from a book or movie.

Let me get to the point, a man (26) from Mexico was living in my hometown temporarily when I was in high school, this was about 4 years ago. I'll call him Jarocho. We matched on tinder at that time, under the circumstances that we both found each other very physically attractive and we were both into cinema. He was and is a filmmaker, a great one at that. I was studying film at my arts high school at the time, so I was especially drawn to him because he was working in the field I wanted to get into. I guess that I would have been 16 then and he would've been around 22. I believe I had my age listed as 18 on tinder (don't need any comments about that, I'm 20 now and I know it wasn't cool.) I was open with Jarocho about my age, though, and it didn't drive him away from our text conversations, all very casual, about movies and music and life in general. We didn't talk a whole lot though, and we didn't meet up at all when he was living in my city. He moved back to Mexico and only remained in my contacts and in my social media. I was sometimes curious about him, but really nothing progressed.

Almost a year later, in late November of 2015, he contacted me. We caught up for a few days, video chatted and talked on the phone even. We gradually learned more of each others' lives. Somehow, it got to a point where he was telling me that he thought he was falling in love with me. These words caught me off guard, and I did not reciprocate them at first as I felt that I still didn't know him all that well. I was intrigued by him, though, so it didn't scare me away. Eventually, I did begin to feel that I was falling for him (or, the idea of him at least.) We spoke to each other as if we were dating, and I told him that I felt the same for him. Here is the crazy part:

He decided (as a complete surprise to me) that the day before new years, he would take a bus from Mexico to my city to see me, and he would stay with family he had there. He arrived on new years eve, and we spent that day and part of the evening together. I didn't stay with him that night, rather I stayed at a friend's house. I kept my meeting with Jarocho a secret, I felt that anyone would think I was insane.

I saw him for the next two days. We got this very cheap, 70's looking motel room where we laid together and made love all day. He took beautiful photos of me there, and we showed each other songs and movies that we loved. Now, I really did feel absolutely in love with this guy. His family was very kind to me, made amazing food, and he was so romantic and gentle towards me. I didn't think about the age difference, since my understanding was that it wasn't such a taboo thing in Mexico and I knew myself to be more mature for my age. This was three years ago, and it was the last time I saw him.

Since then, I've dated other people and he has too. We've gone through times of daily communication, to months without a single message to each other. But every time we do talk, he reinforces just how much in love with me he is, how everyone else is temporary and I am his ultimate dream, and how he hopes that one day I will live in Mexico with him and be his wife and have his kids. It's a lot. I find myself in a difficult situation, because I do feel love for Jarocho. The thought of him is very comforting to be, and many nights I have longed to be there with him and nowhere else.

Just a few months ago, while he was aware that I was in a long term relationship, he got a tattoo of my artwork on him with some meaningful words beside it. A beautiful gesture, but perhaps it freaked me out a bit.

I cannot stop wondering how it is possible for him to love me so consistently for three years. I'm one to worry myself sick... I want to see him as soon as possible. I'm so curious now that I'm older to see how an adult relationship between us would play out, and after a recently failed year long relationship, I'm tired of bs. I think Jarocho is truly who I need to be with. I just wanted to vent about it, I've only told two other people about him and they think both of us are delusional.",love,1549412930,getting-colas,1,1,True,2019-02-05

101,Love requires self reflection and effort always,"I have been in love with my best friend for over two years. I remember before we started dating, I would do everything I could to be around him. When us and our friends would hang out, I would look forward to the end of the night when everyone would exchange hugs simply just to hug him. My friends and I would have bon fires every summer and we'd always end up embracing one and other by the fire. I knew in those moments that I wanted to experience more of him and now I have and it's been wonderful. However, things have not been easy. Right now he's struggling with his mental health and so am I and for the last few days, things seemed really bad. This is not the first time things have gotten dark but I didn't expect them to get dark again recently when they did. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im so proud to say that we've both decided to get help so we can be better for ourselves, each other and the other people in our lives. I just want him to know that he is loved deeply. He is so special and so gentle and so beautiful. I know he doesn't think this but I will tell him until he sees it's truth. I hope as we continue on this journey together, he can begin to realize that he is so deserving of the love he receives and he is *not* worthless. It is a privilege to love him and experience him the way I have. 

Maybe he'll see this. I hope he might. Every one deserves to feel loved and cared for.

109,Feel used and confused,"I am not handsome. I dont have a great personality to just pick up and date women through conversation and charisma. A year back I met this woman who was really into me and I was into her. I met her after my breakup in a really toxic relationship. Things were great at first. 6 months down the line after multiple hangouts and bedroom encounters , I asked her to be exclusive with me. She said she still wanted to see other people and play around with couples. I stuck around. Not sure why but I thought she would ultimately fall for me and say yes. The other reason was she kept introducing me to her family and friends and said I was the best man shes met in 7 years. She introduced me to people like I was her boyfriend but never really gave me that 'title'. It's been 1 year now and she's started hanging out with her ex. She admitted this week that she still had feelings for him. And she's gone cold on me and I started acting desperate and needy because I couldnt handle that. And she went further away. It also didnt help that she moved away from my city to another place 3 hours away. I drunk texted her last night. Asked her if she lost feelings for me and to be honest. She said she is so busy she cant think about these things. Total BS. I feel like a complete loser. On the outside , I have a great job , make good money and have my shit together. On the inside I have been suffering since months now. Every morning I wake up , I think of her. Every night before going to bed , I think of her. She says she still cares for me , but its all just empty words. I want to come back from this. Im turning 27 next month and I feel like I've lost a lot of time and I've fucked things up. I spend every night just drinking alcohol , in the hope that she would go away from my head. I feel used. Like a doormat. I want to be better. Stronger.

110,Hopeless romantic,"So I was raised by my grandfather who pulled out chairs open up the doors and did everything for his wife, my grandmother.! And he instilled a lot of these things in me. It’s been a struggle to find someone to appreciate the little things I do.! Yeah at first it’s nice and they like it. But I always end up getting hurt over and over the nice guys thing finishing last and all that.!  So Im in a new relationship and it’s been awesome she’s really sweet and seems to really appreciate the little things I do .! She’s sick I brought her soup medicine and spent time with her before she went to work. Because I want her to get better and be happy.! She seemed miserable.! Just one of those things I want to do for her. We have gone out to eat been to the drive in I’ve got her flowers for no reason just because I seen them and thought she might like them.! I pay for dinner because I love her and that’s what a man should do is provide for the woman he cares about.! I’m not the richest man but I’m not trying to do everything.! relationships are two people coming together and doing it together having that understanding.!  
So... the dilemma I’m having about all this is idk what to do anymore.! This is all in a few weeks she does seem to a really appreciate everything and has let me know and that’s new to me. And with valentine’s Day coming up I’m wondering if I should just do something casual not over the top.! But nice.! Or just be myself  idk what to do ",love,1549432760,crownpool,6,1,True,2019-02-06
111,Big boy decision,"I need to get this out and I can't really talk to anyone IRL.

Two months ago I met this beautiful girl through a dating website. Cupid's arrow hit us both like a freight train and we fell for each other over a series of dates and romantic evenings. It has been awesome and I can see this woman being my wife in the future. We both are still getting used to each other and learning about our own little quirks, like any new relationship.

This is where making a big boy decision comes into play. 

Last week she was in a minor car accident. She is okay and the legal process has been started to get things sorted out. It gave me a pretty good scare when she told me. The worst part is that she called her ex-boyfriend to pick her up from the accident and help her deal with getting home. I was super pissed. I thought she had cheated (she didn't). I ended up confronting her about it directly (telling her she should have at least called me). This may have been a little heavy handed but I feel that I may be just an option on a list of guys. I am a little bit of the jealous type but I do understand that people need friends outside of their SO. 

In short, I don't want to just be there for the good times with her but I want her to feel like she can call me if something like this happens in the future. (At the time of the accident I was actually waiting to meet up with her and was wondering why she was late and not returning my calls.) 

After a really intense conversion with my girlfriend I decided to stay with her. One way or another I am aware of the consequences of moving past this. I believe that she did not mean to make me feel like an option and was just trying to control the situation and time will tell if this was a one of thing.

I get the feeling that this will be very polarizing to those who read it and I welcome all advice and criticism. ",love,1549432947,Brighter_Lighter,2,1,True,2019-02-06

117,First love never dies even when you move on,"This morning I woke up from a really realistic dream where I met my ex/ first love in a dream place. On the dream we knew it was a safe getaway dream cabin. Some astral shit. We sat criss-cross on the floor chatting about what’s been going on in our lives and catching up. I told him about my job and my dog and new boyfriend and he told me about work and school and didn’t mention his girlfriend but I’ve long suspected they’ve broken up based off things he’s told me. I told him I still miss him a bunch and that when I see him again I’ve still gotta fulfill my promise I made. He asked me what it was but I knew he remembered. I stood up in my dream and at this point he was already standing/leaning against the wall arms crossed and one leg bent foot on the wall. I remember I awkwardly chuckled and told him “pfftt yooou know what promise.”  I remember we weren’t meeting each other’s eyes and he said “but how’s things with your boyfriend?” I responded “ Good,good... I’ve learned a lot.” And real quick I came over too him and slid my hands up his face and  brought my face real close to his and traced his lips with my thumb and looked into his mesmerizing brown and hazel eyes and he spoke to me telepathically asking if this is what I learned and I responded back yes and as soon as I responded I kissed him and his lips seemed softer than my bf which was weird because I’ve only ever kissed his lips and a huge regret I have with my ex/first love is that I was too scared to kiss him I was even scared to hold his hand but at least I did it. Even tho I was a kid back then I got hit with some real feelings. I’m an adult and we both still talk but those feels are still there just buried under years of distraction. 
It’s weird because we meet in our dreams every now and then. It’s not like normal dreams. It leaves me feeling a wave of emotions. I just wanted to tell someone. I honestly don’t think I can love like that again. Don’t get me wrong I really really really like my current SO it’s just that if my ex ever said he was ready to try me again for real that I’d immediately drop everything, buy a plane ticket to the other side of the country for even the slightest hopeful chance it could work. And I hate that about myself and any guy that wants to dedicate his time, love and energy to me deserves it right back damn it. Anyone else would just be satisfactory to me. But I’ve still gotta live my life get married and have kids. You don’t always get your first pick sometimes it’s gonna be the 3rd or 4th maybe not even top 10. That’s life. I hope not tho. Anyways I’m on a 2am rant and I’m sorry. I’ve made my point I think.. goodnight.",love,1549450303,throwawayjustsayhay,6,1,True,2019-02-06
118,.,"I roll in bed,
Soft, soft, soft,
I hear it whisper.

I hear your voice in my head,
Warm, warm, warm,
You hum.

My eyes now wide open,
A billow of your breath,
Washes my senses,
Cleanses my worries.

I remember,
I cry,
I long for,
I accept,
For I know it is too out of reach.

O mother,
O father,
O Lord,
Have you brought me to this world,
To suffer?

Is it me?
Me alone?
Melodramatic?
Maybe, 
Weakness perhaps.

Many have ran,
Many have stayed,
Many have left.

Vicious, 
But beautiful.

Your spirit a fire,
Mine a tsunami.
We put out each other,
A neutrality only attainable through pure,
Burning passion for each other.

I saw the universe in your eyes,
But you merely saw your world in mine.

As I lie in bed, 
Wallowing,
Whining,
Wailing,
I remember.

Soft, like your cheeks.
Warm, like your hugs.
Beautiful, in and out,
I loved you whole.

But a fresh wave hits me,
I see a girl,
Fair, comely,
Perfect.

I wake up from this slumber,
And I weep.
I have realised,
Love,
Though it implores,
Is something I can only wish of feeling.

I look in the mirror,
I know why you left me.
I look at my heart,
Blue from the aching,
Almost beastly looking.

I curl up again,
And as I close my eyes again,
I whisper one last wish.

I want to be loved for who I am.",love,1549451861,daniyal2408,0,1,True,2019-02-06

127,How do i get over someone?,"This is a bit confusin to describe but ill try my best. So i switched to a new school a couple months ago, and then i got locked up and i got held back due to some issues wit my paperwork (i got my current grade lvl classes so thats cool) I wont go into details about the lock up situation because that was a low point for me. But basically, i had to work my ass off in school and i wasnt too focused on social stuff. Romantically i mean. But in class, this girl who i never actually got a good look at started talking and imma be honest, i caught some feelings. I got over them at first but the more i heard her laugh and talk, the more i fell in love wit that. I fucked wit her vibe and shit, and i talked to her whenever i could and that made me fall even more in love. And i use that word loosely, but ive only ever felt this way before once. Like an anxiety attack but it feels good yknow? Anyways, so we end up getting new classes and shit and i found out that she has a boyfriend. If imma be honest that shit kinda hurted. But its whatever to me, she has a boyfriend i wont pursue her romantically anymore. And usually that works, when i find out a girl has a man i back off and just stay as friends and usually my feelings go away. But for some reason i fuckin cant with this girl man. I know whoever shes with is happy and that must make her happy, and thats what i want. But every single time that i look at her i get nervous and shaky and that shouldnt be happening. I just want to be friends at this point but how can i do that when i cant even look her in the eyes cuz shes so fuckin beautiful??? I know shes going through a lot and ive been trying to be there for her and i dont wanna add more stress to her life, because she ends up thinkin that the only reason i started talkin to her was because i was trynna hit it. And i tried backin off but then i saw her sad and shit and i dont know why, its none of my biz or whatever, but it hurt to see her like that. And i at the very least wanna be the dude she can hit up when she has to vent. But i cant do that. So how do i get over my feelings for someone i cant be wit? I want her to be happy and shit, but at the same time i feel like me distancing myself so i can try and figure shit out is actually backfiring. Plus this one hoe is talkin bout how i like her and shit and tellin her shit about me and everytime she does that she looks back at me and laughs. If she was a dude i woulda been handled this but its a john who likes playing the victim and shit. So whatever shes saying to her is also fuckin wit me. But thats off topic at this point im just ranting. But can someone give me tips on how to get over her, please? I dont want these feelings if they end up hurting her.",love,1549483518,Danhawk45,1,1,True,2019-02-06

I don't know why she's doing it, if it is to get me off her, or if it is because she knows my friend likes me, so she's trying to set me up with her.

And this is not the only time she has done something like this for her bff. She pushed one of my friends, who was a past crush of her bff to hang out with her more.

And also, before I had a crush on her bff like 2 years ago but I pussied out. And she always told me I shouldn't, that her bff doesn't like me, etc.

And I mean, I like her, she's smart and witty, but I also have a really solid friendship with her bff, so I don't wanna ruin it lol.

Is she trying to set me up? Why? Should I go for it?

First few months of distance was really hard for me. It’s getting better though, I think the week after leaving is the worst. It’s another three months till we both go home and i’m counting the days. 

When i realized i loved him it as incredibly early in the relationship, i just never clicked with anyone so quickly. it was like two souls coming together. all of our chats were just us laughing our asses off and goofing around. Two months later i finally got the guts to tell him. why is it so hard to tell someone you love them? everything i would try i would just go mute. 

Our relationship is so effortless i’ve never met anyone i’ve connected to this well. he knows everything about me, i wish i had more to tell him. He’s brought out the best person I could me. He makes me feel brave and confident that i can do whatever i set my mind to. which is a big obstacle for me. i want to give him the world. i miss him so much. i wish he was here to hold me. distance sucks :/ ",love,1549531117,jordanndaviis,0,1,True,2019-02-07

146,To my former love,"There is nothing that hurts me more than how I hurt you. I don’t care what you think of me. I want you to hate me if it helps you feel better. I only want you to know that you are absolutely worth everything. You are a deeply beautiful person to your core, and no one else defines that but me. But if it were up to me to define it, I’d tell you all the same. 

Our lives took us in other places, and without you there I got egotistical to try to show myself I was ok without you. I know I finally am, but I still cannot help but look back and hope you are ok. I have a different fond memory of you every day. You taught me so much and you loved me without asking anything in return. You were a treasure and I could never repay you enough in my life. I want you to find true happiness, and I know the best way for me to do that is to let you spread your wings and fly away without me. I hope you know, despite what I said. I bare no ill will toward you. I am no weight upon you; I only hope to see you thrive. Because you have every reason to love yourself. 

Here’s hoping we eventually get to see each other as adults and reminisce fondly. You meant the whole world to me, and I accept responsibility for my recklessness. I’m sorry you had to be taken down with me. But you did help me learn. And now I cannot wait to see you blossom. 

Thank you for a lifetime worth of love and happiness. I hope you are happy. I know the chances of you seeing this are slim, but if your interest or curiosity did bring you here, I just wanted you to know that you are still in my good graces.

Anyways me and said girl broke up last night, her decision.

She also has a difficult time trusting me because I lied to her and honestly I forget where the ""first lie"" even began cause I told myself from the start I was gonna be real with her. That's her reality of the situation but mine is completely different.

I'll sit and let her talk and talk and talk when we're riding in the car about whatever is on her mind and ask her what's on it, I'll try to give some insight on what she's feeling. I let her open up to me a few days ago about some really personal stuff I listened the whole time. 

She would basically imply I put my feelings first and only do stuff unless it benefits me, but for example I was willing to drive 2hrs at 1am to go and get her and bring her back to my house because she was having trouble sleeping out of town. I would also just pick her up in the middle of the night (her home only 30mins away) so she could come over and sleep. I would do my best to always try and make her laugh and keep things random/interesting. I just don't get it. I'm still in love with this woman but I feel like everything is my fault because she's right about a lot of stuff most of the time. Which tears me apart cause I couldn't be the guy for her.

156,A Letter to the Love of My Life,"To the love of my life,

Every occasion I give you a cliché, cheesy, white girl gift. To you - this may be the same as others. But, to me - this is so much different.

It all started while I was a junior in high school, sitting in English class as I watched you walk through the doorway. I wondered to myself, “what would it be like to kiss him?”. A strange, uncommon thought I had from just first glance at a cute boy. Then we were forced to introduce ourselves. I remember how nervous you looked - turned out you didn’t talk to girls back then. But I will never forget those stunning green eyes I looked into. Occasionally, I would stare at you, as you were straight in sight of our teacher. Curly, dirty blonde hair that I wanted to run my fingers through.

The year progressed and we rarely spoke to each other, yet every time we did, I was shocked by how sweet and gentle you were. I knew you were not like every other hormonal, high school boy. So I took a shot, I flirted with you. And when you did not know what the hell to do, I could tell you liked me. I started getting more and more comfortable with the idea of flirting with you, and even though you had my number, I never got a text. So I took it upon myself and texted you. You asked to go for coffee - Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts? Of course being the “white girl” I am, I said Starbucks, though looking back, I know you were counting on the latter.

And then I started to fall in love for the first time. Sitting across from you - you had the cutest expressions on your face. I remember smiling so much my cheeks started to twitch. I tried to stop, fearing I looked like a witch, but I could not. I wanted to reach out and touch your hand so badly, they looked so soft and big compared to mine. I remember how shocked you were that I was into classic rock - Aerosmith and the Eagles. We had the same taste in music, until I mentioned  the good old Taylor Swift. As we walked together out to the parking lot, I remember how badly I wanted to lean in and hug you, feel your warm arms around me and breathe you in. You waved.

I was hooked on you, like no other guy I had dated before. When you asked me out again, I could not help but smile ear to ear for the next week.

— —

Flash forward three years and we are in college. Young and in love. Yet, I was having an internal battle with myself. I daydreamed about kissing you on what could be our wedding day, but then scared that if I ever said anything, you would freeze up, and shut me out. The worst feeling possible. So I never said anything, knowing that a nine-teen year old girl was way too young to make decisions about the rest of my life, and knowing the vulnerability it would take for me to speak of how much I loved you.

And then this year rolled around. Winter break was finally here and we spent all of our living moments together. Not only was I in love with you, but I was in love with your family, and the idea of being a part of it forever. I realized there would be no point to my life without you in it. You had been with me through the lowest point in my young life so far - from friends committing suicide to my stomach disease that always seemed to beat me. You were always patient, understanding, and had kind encouraging words to say. You were thoughtful and genuine, something I had never seen in any man before. Every quality you had was something I admired, and something I looked for in a future life partner.

Then, we started to talk jokingly about our future together, knowing nothing was set in stone. There were many ‘what ifs’ we would talk about. “What if you caught our child in a lie? What age could they get phones? What kind of dog would we get?”. The list was endless. And I found myself wanting to have more and more of those types of conversations with you. I wanted to talk about having a potential future with you - not just a dreamlike one. I slowly came around to the idea that I wanted you in my near future, not wanting to get hurt. I brought it up and you felt the same way. I was delighted, but still unsatisfied. I wanted more. The more and more time we spent together, the more and more I feel in love with you, and the idea of spending eternity with you. But I could not admit that to myself for a long time. But suddenly, every song on the radio was about us. Every other relationship I saw, I thought, “wow, we’re better than that” or “we handle problems so much healthier”. Not only did I see that our relationship was thriving, but I know we both felt fire inside. And then I finally began to realize where my feelings were headed. I was terrified. At twenty years old, how could I have a feeling so strong inside of me, that it started to burn inside my heart and it was all I could see? I wanted to marry you. I secretly fantasized about the day we would move in together, the dog we would get, and the wedding I wanted so badly. Admitting these feelings to myself made me feel vulnerable, and I knew there was no way I would bring this topic up.

But me being who I am, I spilled the beans when I was not sober. I remember saying “If it were up to me, I would marry you one day”. And then I cried. I could not believe I told you my deepest, most vulnerable thoughts. I could not look you in the eyes, fear of rejection. Fear that this was the moment I would lose you forever. And my world would be over. But then, from what I remember (not so clearly), you made me look you in the eyes, and you said “I feel the same way about you”. Then I cried for two hours, maybe more. You said you had been feeling this way for a while, but did not want to say anything because you were scared of rejection too, and maybe you knew I was not there just yet. I constantly ask you to repeat the events that occurred that night. I tell you it is because I cannot remember any of it, which is a lie. But I wanted to hear your side of the story. Your own true feelings about us tying the knot one day.

Since that moment, I endlessly annoy you about this topic to the point where you probably just want me to shut up. I do not blame you. But, to be fair, I have never been happier about anything in life until that moment. I think about it every day, over and over. I think about the conversations we had after, “how many kids do you want?” “What kind of dog should we get?” And the name of our first son we agreed upon.

So what is the point of me writing this?

I want you to know that being with you makes me feel happy, alive, and the most loved person in this world. I have never felt this way about anyone before. No one can make me smile the way you make me do. I cannot wait to see you again. I cannot wait for the day we move in together. I cannot wait for the day you ask me to spend the rest of my life with you. I cannot wait to have beautiful children with you. And I cannot wait to have a lifetime of memories with the man I love.

I will love you forever, through thick and thin, for better or for worse, and in sickness and in health.

Happy Birthday handsome.",love,1549569130,camp121,7,1,True,2019-02-07
157,A story I wrote for her,So let me tell you a story of a man named Loneliness. We'll just call him L for short. L was a man of his word. Some would say he was a man of Virtue. L was missing something in his life. L would always work and come home and sleep till he had to go back. There was this girl L had seen online. She was the prettiest of pretty. His jaw dropped to the floor when he saw her. He knew right then she had to be told she was perfect and that's what he did. He left her a message saying she was perfect. He soon found out her name was Enigma but we'll just call her E for short. She was a very confident person. Some would call her an Optimist . Her beauty beyond compare. L just knew he had to come meet her after a few weeks and she agreed. When L saw E in person he just knew it was meant to be. So he asked her out and she replied obviously. It's been 3 amazing months. Together Loneliness with his Virtue and Enigma with her Optimist well they created something magical. They were intertwined into LOVE. ,love,1549571638,zabbering,0,1,True,2019-02-07

160,Should I [22M] marry my best friend [24F]," 

*TL;DR I finally met a woman I'm happy with but I'm not sure if I should marry her or not because I find other women in the street more attractive.*

This is gonna be abit of a messed up story so here me out. I know I'm no angle but I'm trying to be better so no need to call me an abusive asshole and hate on me.

So for my whole live I've been celibate because of two reasons. The first is because of my religion I don't believe in casual sex and so I didn't date any girls during my teenage years although there was plenty of opportunities.

I also have anxiety and ASD which made it really difficult for me to date women during university and this combined with high standards made it difficult to meet any women.

Last year I was struggling with health related anxiety and feeling really lone so I kept praying to God to let me marry a hot nurse because I thought that would solve all my problems.

I ended up having an arranged marriage through family to an aspiring student nurse who I rate about 7-8/10 in terms of looks and 10/10 in every other way possible.

So I was super excited and couldn't believe that this was real for the first two months then our families had an argument and anxiety kicked in.

This is when I turned into a supreme bitch and told her to loose weight and get bigger boobs constantly because I was scared that I would not like her body (I haven't seen it). I kept constantly talking about her body and how we could make it better and couldn't get over the fact that if we get married there will be hotter girls in the world.

We briefly broke up and got back together and in the end she said that I could marry her and if I fell in love with someone else I could marry her too and we could all be polyamours together (this is a thing in our religion where I guy can have many wives).

So I felt like that was the best solution. My problem now is that I know there's better looking girls out there but if I break up with this girl I might never have better. Her personality seems perfect to me but then again I have nothing to compare against, but she seems to be very kind and loving and understanding.

She has lost weight and slightly boosted her breasts but she said that she can't change anymore at this point.

I do feel a deep connection with her and miss her when she's not there and I love spending time with her. She is my best friend now and a breakup would be heart breaking for both of us and especially her since she loves me so much.

But every time I see hotter girls with better bodies it pisses me off so much. I also don't know why she loves me so much because I feel like I'm unlovable and have nothing good to offer her.

What should I do? Should I marry this girl or not?

\*It's a faith marriage only not legally binding.

Every night in bed I lay and wonder, is someone else making you smile now? Is someone else the reason for your happiness? Who are you telling your deepest darkest secrets to these days? Who is the one who gets to hug and kiss you? And do I ever cross your mind? Do you ever wonder what it would be like if we stayed together? Because I sure do.

172,I’m falling in love with my best friend.,"I’m laying here on my couch in my quiet apartment thinking about how I’ve been caught so utterly and completely off guard. There’s somebody asleep in my cozy bed because he works tomorrow. The guy who’s sat up all night and listened to me cry about other men hurting me, secretly jealous inside, never having made a single move or gesture to suggest that he even liked me that way. 

I’ve been 100% myself around him since the first day; that cold October night of my birthday weekend, when we were sent out together for alcohol and took our sweet time coming back. We both had somebody else at that time so nothing but getting to know each other innocently had happened. Since then we’ve talked daily, hung out regularly, gotten drunk and joked and cried to each other. He’s held my hair for me while I puked after too much Captain Morgan’s, and then let me sleep on his lap after a while of ultra-drunken sobbing about boys who don’t matter. Gradually growing closer but never too close. He’s met my daughter (he’s her favourite), my mother, sisters, all of my friends. 

He’s not my usual type either. He’s tall, dark skinned and classically handsome — and I’ve kind of stuck to “outsiders”, complete losers or the lanky, dorky type. He likes to look sharp and when I borrow his clothes, I swim in them. (Score, fuck yeah.) Not to mention I usually shoot for much older guys and this one is only 3 months older than I am. 

However, I’m not his usual type either. He loves beachy goddesses with long legs, blonde hair, and perfect bodies. I’m 5’7 with a chubbier build, short black hair and a wild and silly personality and a need for making people laugh. I never looked at this guy as anything more than a great friend, maybe mainly because I thought he would never look at me as more than that. 

A few days ago I found out that I was wrong. I left to travel to the city to hang out with a Tinder match I’d gotten a couple days prior, and my friend was at my house with me watching me get ready for my date. He kept making comments about how silly I was to drive two hours that late at night to hang out with somebody new, and I could kind of tell he didn’t want me to go. I went anyway. Half way there I get a text that he was jealous I had left, and that he wished I’d stayed behind to hang out with him instead... that was followed by another text about how he wished we could just be together. I spent my whole night and next morning regretting going and eager to arrive home and see my “friend” again. 

Fast forward to today, we’ve spent every night and day together since then, snuggling and watching movies, playing with my daughter, visiting friends and family and just generally being happy. It took him until last night to even kiss me, and we’ve probably kissed 428 times since then. Nothing feels forced or rushed. It’s the most oddly beautiful experience. I don’t feel pressured to sleep with him nor him me, and I just know it’ll be so perfect when it does happen. I’m nervous and anxious for what this means for us. 

As I’ve laid here, I’ve come to the amazing realization that I’ve never been anything but real with him, he’s seen my wild side, my wacky side, my emotional side — every side there is to me, he’s witnessed it, and he still wants to be with me. I can’t think of any other time that this has been the case. I’m always hiding something about who I am out of the fear that whoever I’m seeing will change their mind about me because of it. But with this guy, I’ve never had to do that because we were only friends. I’m truly excited and I feel so genuinely happy. 

I just needed to spill this somewhere before I go crawl back in bed. I hope everybody find something as comfortable as this is, because it can really only be likened to pure bliss. 🥰

173,Having feelings for someone I can’t have…,"Don’t really have anyone I can talk to, and I just wanna let this out:

So… long story short, I had a friend for quite a few years I grew very attached to and whom I seriously fell in love with. Our friendship became kinda tense and full of arguing and negative shit, so we just stopped talking for most of last year. And well… I had actually grown quite independent during that time; I started to focus more on myself and I felt like I was really growing in that respect. I thought, like, I was finally over her for good.

Then, all of a sudden, we gradually started talking again… We both used to be in kind of a dark place back then (certainly darker than now, at least) and we’ve both grown and shit, so it’s been really cool so far. Like, she’s really nice and supportive, and all in all, things are just good between us. She may not be perfect and kind of a complicated person too, but hey, so am I. 

Here’s the thing, though… I am having feelings, people:(  At first, I was intending to keep the friendship casual and not end up caring as much or getting as attached again. I thought I had outgrown her, and I didn’t think myself capable of feeling these things again, yet here I am. 

It all started with the realization that I still kinda liked her, that she still made my heart go crazy, and shit like that… I still got kinda sad at times and whatnot, but it was still not such a big deal; it was still kinda manageable, if you know what I mean. I may still have loneliness issues and shit, but I’d been able, so far, to push myself into doing all (or most) of the shit I wanna do and just keep carrying on with my life.

I’m a really motivated person, and I got so many dreams, and goals, and shit… Until lately, I’ve been really focused on myself, on my studies… I’ve recently begun doing parkour, which is really cool… You get the idea, hopefully. But… I met with her last Monday, and OMG… it was so fucking awesome; I just lay on the grass next to her, we were real close, I hugged her tight 🤤… Some next-level shit, lol. And by that, I meant she made me feel so fucking good… In a way literally nobody and nothing else can. And it’s just been real hard getting her off my mind ever since.

I feel really uncomfortable when I’m just doing nothing or wasting my time and shit, but I think that’s kind of what I’ve been doing these past few days. I’ve seriously tried pushing myself and all that… but it’s like I just don’t feel the energy and shit. I don’t wanna neglect my parkour training, or my workout routine, or my studies… or anything, really; but it’s like, at the same time, I would feel and not feel like doing any of those things. Like, I try to, but it’s just so hard and not the same at all. This shit’s really brought me down, and it’s becoming a serious obstacle for me.

Now, it’s bringing me down because I just like her so fucking much, and I wanna get even closer and shit, yet I know that is not nor will ever be possible 😔. I’d already kinda admitted to myself I may like her and shit, but I also accepted we would never be together or anything, maybe that we weren’t even meant for each other, and I was okay with that. I was okay with that because I seriously wanna focus on myself and my own shit, because I know there’s nothing I could ever do about it, because I really thought I might even be better off, and well… I also didn’t wanna turn this into an “issue” or make such a big deal out of it. I didn’t want it to become and obstacle or anything; just wanted to keep things rather casual. I still try to think I’m okay with it and shit, but it still hurts, y’know? More and more every day, apparently…

I’m feeling sad, hurt; it’s getting hard to focus on other things without the thought of her getting in front of everything else; and, Idk, I’m just feeling a bit depressed and not as motivated, I guess:( I’m not even eating much anymore and I just feel like staying in bed and shit… And I really wanna do things and all, but I feel like I just can’t. And that’s fucking frustrating, ‘cause I just wanna keep living my life and shit, yet here I am, apparently unable to stop thinking about someone I had supposedly outgrown and will never be able to have anyway 😔. Seems like bullshit to me… But this is kinda my life right now, I guess. 

Anyways, that’s it. If you’ve read up to this point, I appreciate it :3 If not, I guess just writing about it made me feel a little better, which is what I came here to do, anyhow.",love,1549615064,pelirodri,0,1,True,2019-02-08

I love writing for you. I’ve always been a “words of affirmation” person but for some reason written language is the best way for me to get across just how deeply in love with you I am.

Every part of last night was perfect. Being in your arms and your lap was what my body desperately needed. Sparks fly when we kiss. We are so hungry for each other and I’ll never get my fill of you. The way you kiss me is this perfect mix of desirous, aggressive, and absolutely delicious with delicate, sweet, and affectionate. I love how we kiss each other: the way your tongue dances around my mouth, the way your lips feel against mine and how you can’t get enough. The fact that just being in your lap sent me over the edge of pleasure makes it even harder to get by until you can take me as yours.

But your sex isn’t far from being the only thing that I crave and love. I love your mind, your intellect. You are so smart, and I love how informed you are. You hate being like uninformed morons we deal with daily and I love your desire to know more. 

You are absolutely hilarious. I love your jokes and your sense of humor. I love how you love to make me laugh. That one day is when you knew you had me in. You played up being thrown around and me laughing so hard I could barely breathe. I love how you make me smile and will do anything to make me happy. I hope that if my clumsiness comes with any perks is that it makes you laugh at least. 

Your love for others is absolutely wonderful. Just the way you love me alone is so overwhelmingly perfect. You protect me and never let anyone hurt me. And the way you get just a little jealous when guys try to flirt with me is so damn cute (and hot) but I think you love the fact that I am clueless to it most of the time. I love how safe I feel in your arms. I love that I have told you everything about me, even things I have never told anyone else. I trust you completely, with every part of me. 

You are my everything. Everything bit of me is yours for as long as you want me. ",love,1549643737,HisLittleSexKitten2,0,1,True,2019-02-08
183,This is tough to say...,"I love him very much and he is the sweetest ,most caring and loving boyfriend there could ever be but I feel like a horrible girlfriend and crappy because I'm not attracted to his body. It feels even worst because I know I'm not the picture of perfection (I know no one is and I'm working on it) but he seems to see me as so attractive and I wanna be able to give him back the same attraction. I don't wanna hurt him so I haven't been able to tell him this. I do love his face and I find his facial features attractive ,sexy even but I don't think that would matter if I mention the body part and it would just crush him:( it breaks my heart to feel this

He used to find me hilarious. He used to think I was the sexiest alive. Does it all just start to fade over time or am I supposed to play him at his own games?

I treat that boy like a king so it’s only fitting that he do the same.. he’s giving up on winning me over and showing me off.. we live together and all..

190,"7 years and a joke of a relationship later, I finally met her!","Half the people that read this aren't even gonna go through the whole thing! 

For the typos, if any, please understand that I wrote all this in one go.

We first met in 2nd grade, when I was a fresher at her school. I don't mean to be cliche when I say she was pretty even by 2nd grade standards, and that's saying something.

She had straight flowy pixie hair and she had something of an attitude at the time, she was kinda like the cool girl you wanna be friends with (you don't ask them out in second grade!), But she's way too cool to be with a loser like you!

No I didn't fall in love with her then. But that flowy hair of hers and her smile I never got out of my head even after I transferred to another school the next year, leaving her behind.

The last day of third grade was the last time I saw her.

I made friends in the new place but whenever I thought of the old school I always remembered her. A few more years and puberty later, I started wondering what she might look like after so many years. Obviously with her being that pretty even in 2nd grade, I could only keep my hopes up high of what she looked like at the time.

You see I'd made my Facebook profile at a very young age and every year since I'd signed up, I'd search her name, but to my disappointment I never found her in it. I guessed she wasn't on Facebook... Yet.

And one lucky day, I searched her up and she did turn up. I couldn't find any pictures of her so I messaged her and  from the way she texted I figured I'd pretty much blown all my chances of being with her. I mean, she was nice to me, but I knew that was just her nature of being nice even to those who annoyed her. 

Eventually I just forgot about her and just became your average teenager. I decided it was time to focus more on studies, but that was when puberty hit the brain and he feelings came in!

7 years since I'd last seen her and a joke of a relationship later, I met her again.

I'd finished my tenth grade and I decided to change schools for the last two years of school life. Luckily I wasn't going alone, I had two of my best friends with me.

It was fresher's day, and the place I'd joined had this whole ceremony for the fresher's. 

They called each of the fresher's by name onto the stage, and mid walk to the stage I saw her.

Yeah I saw her. 

Blue jeans and a red and black hoodie, that's what she was wearing. 

And there I stood staring with my jaw dropped. 

No words could describe how beautiful she looked. I could give you a piece of my mind and you still wouldn't find a word for how beautiful she looked that day!

And then she saw me and I'd be exaggerating if I said she did the same thing I did. I'll admit she was surprised to see a familiar face. Yeah that's what I was, a familiar face to her.

But holy crap she looked so effing pretty that day!

But she was still staring at me, and then came the smile, and then she waved the cutest HI in the whole dang world! A million things ran through my head!

When the ceremony actually began , they gave each of us this fancy candle we had to use to light this huge lamp they had there. And she was on the other side when she lit hers and you could say I was lucky I didn't burn myself up from the excitement!

I don't mean to sound like a creep but I stared at her the rest of the day when we moved to class. 

I reached home and the first thing I did was look her up and I texted her.

That was literally the first time we'd talked in nine freaking years!

And the funny thing was she was being too awfully nice to me. And over the course of the next few months we'd become closer and closer, and text for longer. It started close to an hour but two months in and we texted for like seven hours straight per day. 

She made me happy. I was happy before but she had such a character. The kind that made you laugh out loud while texting and get that strange look from the person sitting next to you. The kind that makes you fall in love.

We started talking more personal things, she told me of her ex, I told her of mine. We were being vulnerable with each other and we were just friends and I wanted more and more!

Eventually it reached the point where I couldn't hold on any longer and I told her I had a crush on someone. By that time she'd become my best friend and she badly wanted to find out who it was. And we made this game where she'd guess and I'd tell if she'd gotten it right but the catch was she could only ask ONE NAME per day. And every day first thing she'd text me would be a random girl from our class and I'd say no and she'd keep asking and I'd keep pointing out that she was  breaking the rules. And the poor little thing would comply in disappointment and God that made me wanna tell her. 

And one day I decided it couldn't go on any longer. And that day she guessed another name and as usual I said no. And I was about to get serious and tell her when she asked me very seriously if it was her. The feeling when she asked me that I really can't put it into words, and I'm not gonna try!

She said she knew it all along, and she asked if I really really liked her and I said yes. And then her, being the sweetest girl in the world, turned me down but in the nicest, sweetest possible way.

I was sad, depressed, hurt, but not angry, since I figured it was because I'd known her properly only for a few months and she didn't trust me yet. 

But then she told me she didn't wanna go through the emotional roller coaster again. She told me she'd disappoint me, that she's hurt me and she didn't want any of that, but I didn't care.

I didn't care if she hurt me, I told her I'd take care of her, love her, and I didn't care if that was way way too soon for those things to be said but she only turned me down. 

And then she opened up. She said her ex wasn't her first boyfriend. She'd been together with two other guys too and she'd dumped them because she lost her feeling for them! She talked to me how she didn't trust her own feelings, and how she promised herself that she would never get in a relationship again. That's when she told me we should remain friends because what we had was special. 

We got closer, and I asked her out again, and she rejected me again. And I started losing hope. And I have no idea how cringey or desperate or cute this may sound but I literally prayed to God for her to say yes!

And yet that did nothing. And months later, I told her for the last time that I was in love with her, that it wasn't a crush, that I really couldn't move on no matter how much I tried, that I wished every girl I saw was her, that I missed her every second that we weren't texting, that no person had ever made me as happy as she had, and that I'd take care of her and if she said yes I'd never leave her and I promised that on my life!

And she rejected me again.

I really cried hard that night.

And I guess for the longest time I tried not talking to her about this particular topic but one day we were texting and I laughed so hard. And all of a sudden I had to say I love you. And she texted me back ""I know"" and unless you've been there, that's the saddest feeling you could possibly have.

And then we were talking of our ambitions and our dreams and stuff and I was talking how my dream other than winning her love was to get into the most prestigious University there and to start a company and stuff.

That was when she asked if that's how much she meant to me and I said she meant everything to me and I swear my heart ached when I said that and it still does!

And she said it.

The magic words. I love you.

I was home alone at the time and I was jumping around the whole damn place in excitement.

We went on a date. We shared a smoothie, I fed her a piece of cake, I held hands with her for the first time. 

There's nothing quite as magical as love. 

Sad to say, she was the one who kissed the first time.

Months after the first date, we were on another date, and it was getting late fir her and she had to go, and I was sad and she saw that, and she leaned down and kissed me on the lips. And I have no idea how long it lasted, but those few seconds if my life I blacked out.

All I remember was the daze I was in afterwards and her coy smile from her accomplishment.

I love her.

I fucking love her. And she's the one. Yes we fight a lot, but God every time we look into each other we just melt, every time I get to hold her, that warmth I get in my heart, nothing can give me that but her. And sometimes it worries me if she's gonna take so much care if me that it might badly affect our kids. 

We were meant to be.

If you're reading this and still haven't found love, believe me, you will. There's a certain someone in this world who's waiting for you. And you're gonna find them or they're gonna find you. Either way, you're gonna find the kind of happiness that no drug can recreate. You're gonna have feelings that you've never had before. Believe me, you're gonna find someone.

191,On retrograde jealousy,"I just want you to know, although I don't know if I'll show it to you, that from the very first time I met you I knew I was going to fall in love with you. It was a matter of when. I love all the moments I've been able to spend with you and want so many more. I relieve the conversations that we have, and although some of them trigger jealousy in me I wouldn't ever change anything. I'm working on myself and trying to keep your past in my past and not my present. I'm trying to quit the cycle if negative thoughts that really are just my own imagination torturing me. It always helps me to look at pictures of you, or the few that I have where we are together. It helps to think about all the places I want to go with you. All the places I want to show you and all the ones I want you to show me. I'm working on myself, trying to keep my mind clear and return to that carefree positive person that I remeber being when I first met you. It can be hard to break the pattern but my love for you is going to help me get through this and one day I'll look back on this and laugh. Because this is not who I am, it's something I'm going through. It doesn't define who I will become. I am not set on one path. I can choose any path I want and I will be happy on it as long as I remeber that I have you on my side and nothing else matters.

She doesnt want to date me, but says she has feelings for me. So I guess I was always hopeful she would change her mind.

I honestly really like her and I dont know how I'm going to feel with the days to come. I knew months ago I should end it. But I didnt want to cause to me she seemed amazing and perfect. In my eyes, I could look past all her flaws. That's probably why this hurts so much.

Even now I want to be with her. Even after telling her we need to separate from one another.

194,exceptionally good looking girl cannot find “the one”,"Dear reddit users,

I am going to be frank, so brace yourself for what might seem like an arrogant post. 

I am an exceptionally beautiful 25 year old woman. I know this because I have been told this repeatedly (since I was 14). I have heard many men say that I am the most beautiful woman they have ever seen. Honestly, I really am at least a 9/10 from what I can tell. In addition to that, I have a law bachelor and masters, so I’m also (at least on paper) quite smart. My family is what people would describe as “upper middle class” (I cringe so bad when I say this but ok.): we have two beautiful homes and have travelled to many countries. moreover, I am passionate about learning mandarin and animals (I work at a shelter). The most important part is that I am quite a humble person (I know my previous description of myself would suggest otherwise). Honestly, I know my “market value” is really high, mainly due to my exceptional looks.

The problem is that I am looking for a boyfriend who will want to marry me, but have not had success finding the one yet and I am starting to get worried. I have encountered many men who are interested, but I am not interested in them. I have also had dates with guys that I actually like and for some strange reason they do not seem to pursue me. I am starting to wonder if it is because I am to good for them. 

I would love to know how beautiful women like me got to find the one. For me, “the one” is a guy I am attracted to, who is really smart and successful and who treats me well. I honestly do not care about family background, nor does he have to be really hot or good looking. 

Am I approaching this whole dating thing in a too transactional way? I would love to hear your opinions, don’t be afraid to share your criticisms!! I would also like to know if men won’t go on a second date because they feel like you’re too smart/ well travelled for them. Is that a thing??

196,"I have a crush on this girl at a work placement course, HELP!","Hi,

Firstly I would like to make clear that I am a religious and practicing person.

Basically, I joined this work placement to help me with my career and there's this girl who also enrolled. It's a 3 week program. She's cute and hot. First day was good, normal, I concentrated literally on the course as I am serious about my career now. Today was the second day and I actually sat next to her. It was like I was just going with my inner self. But I kept it normal and we were also talking, we worked in a group etc. But now which I don't really mind and care is that, I think, she is also interested in this other guy in the course who I could tell that he's also into her. At the end of the day, he made the move, I saw him walking with her and I was going the same way, and he was asking her what she doing tonight etc.

As I am a religious person, it kept me from going any further. I just kept it like this. It's a really weird and complicated feeling. I never actually been in this situation in my life before. I had been through high school, college etc but I never thought of this ever. Due to my commitment to religion, I feel I wanna go forward (which I know won't and can't) and also not to. Main trigger was that guys move, it's made me a little angry and stressed but also anxious about my self and the course.

This man is everything I could have ever wanted and more. He’s amazing and comes from a beautiful family and has had nothing less than a wonderful upbringing. 

Meanwhile, I was experienced more traumatic experiences before the age of seven, beginning at almost four years old. 

I am so afraid I am going to lose this man due to my inability to work through what has happened to me and his inability to understand because he has never gone through anything remotely close. 

The irony being that part of me truly love the fact that he comes from an extremely loving family. His family and upbringing give me so much hope. I never knew that being happy and whole was a real possibility. 

I guess my biggest concern is that I am reverting back to my old ways and self sabotaging.

212,my love story,"je souhaite à personne ce que je vais vous raconter

bonsoir à tous le monde je vais vous raconter ma petite histoire assez peu intéressante mais j’avais envie de la partager aux autres :

pourquoi je ne me suis jamais mis en couple depuis mes 12 ans (j’en ai 16 et bientôt 17) ?

je ne dirais pas le prénom de cette fille ni autre information pourrant la reconnaître.

tout commence quand j’étais au collège en classe de 5ème, et comme à peu près tout le monde à ce moment on avait pour la plus part un téléphone avec des réseaux du type snap insta ou fb

un beau jour une fille s’abonne à moi et ayant peu d’abonnés je vais voir son profil et la c’est presque le coup de foudre

mais de suite dans sa bio je vois qu’elle vie aux alentours de Lyon

je la trouve exceptionnellement belle, la première fois que je « rencontre » une personne aussi belle
(a savoir que moi à 12 je me basais plus sur le physique et sur le mental)

je dirais que environ 1 semaine après l’avoir follow back je vois qu’elle m’envoie un message

donc on continue à parler pendant 1-2 mois je dirais et on se met en « couple » virtuellement je dirais car on ne s’étais jamais appeler ou facetime

on arrête de se parler sans trop de raison au bout d’un an de messages dont je suis fou amoureux et j’insiste sur le mot fou

on se reparle de temps en temps en 4 eme puis en 3 eme et a chaque fois on se reparle plus malgré mon envie folle de lui parler. J’étais aussi vraiment timide alors j’hésitais a lui envoyer un message par peur de la déranger ou de l’ennuyer

et vous me direz mais c’est débile ce que tu dis ! tu ne vas pas embêter qqn en voulant simplement lui parler ! mais je vous assure que quand on est follement amoureux(se) d’une personne qu’on a jamais vu etc on a peur de faire une bêtise

je démange sur les alentours de bordeaux donc je m’éloigne encore plus d’elle - mes parents ou ma soeur n’ont pas la connaissance de cette fille et sa famille de même pour moi.

arrive l’année scolaire de seconde et j’essaie de lui parler de plus en plus pour rester en contact et essayer de sortir avec elle

l’année se termine et on entame tout juste les grandes vacances ! Je lui parle beaucoup elle me parle moins 

moment cruciale puisque ont a prévu de se rencontrer pour la première fois depuis 4 ans d’attente derrière un écran

je lui donne rdv sur une grande plage devant un casino à Biarritz , la météo n’est pas avec nous on va se réfugier sous un petit arbre sous nos téléphones et on prend 2-3 photos puis l’heure viens pour elle de rentrer au camping

2 jours plus tard (toujours en vacances) je vais à son camping et puis on reste pas loin de 2 h ensemble et je trouve ça trop court.
on refais des photos on parle de tout et de rien.

viens le moment pour elle de repartir chez elle a côté de Lyon je n’ose pas lui faire de câlin ou de l’embrasser alors que j’en meurt d’envie et d’impatience depuis 5 ans

ça y est elle est partie et je luis juste fait une simple bise.

je rentre chez moi et je reste stoïque face à ma famille c’est le soir je vais me coucher et je ne cesse de pleurer

je pleure pendant 3 semaines tous les soirs et j’en pleure actuellement au moment où j’écris tout ça

à peu près 1 mois après s’être rencontré sur une plage elle stop tous contact avec moi... elle commence par me bloquer sur snap (ça efface toute les conversations) je ne comprend pas pourquoi elle réagis comme ça elle continue sur insta mais à chaque fois que je lui demande de me débloquer elle essaie de m’embrouiller

et je finis par céder face à ses réactions à droite à gauche donc je lui dis clairement que tu m’as trop fais souffrir a me faire espéré une telle aventure que je pensais réel je lui dis que je ne veux plus qu’elle me parle pcq je voulais essayer d’oublier tout ça mais impossible elle continue et ne s’arrête pas

aujourd’hui encore elle est revenu me parler et à chaque message que je reçois d’elle une larme tombée je me dis mais pourquoi tu n’as pas essayer de l’embrasser.

je n’arrive toujours pas à tourner la page puisque à chaque fois que je vois sa tête sur l’icône de profil je la trouve beaucoup trop belle.

si jamais tu lis ceci sache que je t’aime toujours et que cela n’as pas changer depuis 5 ans. Je t’aime du plus profond de mon âme. 

voilà mon petit thread est terminé j’espère c’était pas trop long et que ça vous a plus ",love,1549724135,Paralax51,2,1,True,2019-02-09
213,"Am I in love? I'm very confused, its it because of the distance? How can I fix it?","I have the most perfect boyfriend. Same humor, same kinks (lol), intelligent, rational, reasonable, loyal, strong, hard working etc. And he loves me extremely. We never argue and he loves to pamper me and meet all my needs. And I love him, I cried over the thought of hurting him. But we're LDR and we've only been together three times one week each. It was always a little weird for me, he was exactly the same but I didn't feel ""a pull""? I don't know how to explain it. I was paranoid of him giving PDA, I didn't kiss him much even at home (but we did a lot of sexual things so). I've always questioned my physical attraction, I thought he was kinda cute despite not being exactly my type and in person it was even more strange for me. I'm way more in it for personality. I don't like talking about my relationship to anyone and i'm not sure why. Also I'm very emotionally calm, i dont tend to feel extremes that often. I rarely had butterlies, just this feeling of comfort and the need to tell him that I loved him back, that's how it started, but since i'm the way I am I concluded that's my special way of feeling love. The very first time we met it was in bad conditions and I really didn't like him, but since we continued to text and call I couldn't help grow fonder so the next time he came back it was better. I was very nervous because i didn't know what was going to happen, but very calm when we eventually had sex. I genuinely can't think of any cons from his part. He's not interested in other people like normal dudes would, he needs emotional connection to really care. He can look at naked girls and not give a shit but if it's me he goes crazy. It's just so ideal. He actually would sacrifice so much for me. What can I do to fix myself? What is even wrong with me? Is it because I never see him? Or maybe because I have depression? I worded all of this horribly and I know I sound really naive. He's my first relationship, we're 20, it's been almost 2 years.",love,1549726623,Bidets4Americans,0,1,True,2019-02-09

I tricked myself in believing that you somewhat like me back to some degree, but I now know that is false. I thought that the moments we shared were worth as much to you as they meant to me. How foolish am I to believe someone that is 4 years older would think of me when I leave the room. Still, it hurt so bad when I found out you were with someone else. All my hope was gone. I started to feel.... empty again. I really didn't want this, so I fought myself for you. I just want you to know that I won. I still love you so much that I would give anything to make you happy; but I realize that you probably want me to give nothing. That person makes you happy and not me, and I understand that. I really don't want to accept it still, but I'm beginning to comprehend that you absolutely do not care about me at all. It also still hurts a lot, but you don't know that I feel this way about you, so it's not your fault that im in pain.

Your goofiness? And lovable stupidity?

How can I describe your breath taking eyes?How they take me to a place far away?


What if I told you that you made my day?

That a single minute of your attention, makes me smile and excited and happy?

What if I told you that you're special to me?

That I don't know what I'd do anymore if you left my side?


What if I told you these things?

Would our friendship stay strong or be able to grow stronger?

Would you be able to give me a chance?

Would you return my feelings?

Would you cherish me the way I love you?


...


Or would I fall away to the side of the road?

Rejected, just another girl whose heart you broke?

Would our friendship crumble if I spoke the truth?

Would you avoid me because of how I feel?

Would you choose her over me?

Would I always and forever be only just a friend?

I met this guy(my current boyfriend) at a 3 day field trip, which consisted of going north to Sierra High school and south to Disneyland. Those 3 days with the guy were one of the best 3 days of my life and I slowly begin to fall in love with him. After I broke up with my ex. I began to talk more with him. Fast forward 5 months and I’m dating him. With him I’ve had the happiest time of my life and I couldn’t have asked for anyone better. Those moments are so pure that nothing could’ve made them bad or negative. And that is what love is. Being able to have these pure, beautiful moments that you wish you could relive with whoever.

228,Fell for a friend....,"I’ve got a friend who came out of a relationship 5 months ago, she was controlling and has changed his mindset completely, he feels he’s never good enough for anyone thanks to her destructive mental manipulation.
He and I have been flirting for a while and we recently slept together, this has happened 3 times. I have real deep feelings for him, but he blows hot and cold all the time. Just a few days ago we agreed to be just friends as he could feel the relationship getting serious and he doesn’t want that, but then told me he was getting feelings for me but he watched his ex fall out of love with him and he can’t go through that again. Long story short it was very sad but lovely, anyway he ended up picking me up from work and we drove for 5.5 hours just talking and enjoying each other’s company, we didn’t kiss or anything just had a lovely time, planned a trip for the next week and carried on. Friday comes around, we’re drunk, we kiss, he wakes up with the fear and basically says he wants to be my friend, but we can’t see each other for a while whilst the attraction and feeling is there and that I mean more to him as a friend and he doesn’t want to waste my time. I feel really really sad and out of control because I just don’t understand, like what is so wrong with maybe having feelings for me? It’s worth noting that he instigated this and told me I’m hard to read and had mixed signals so I didn’t pressure anything. I’m confused and hurt because I was happy with our friendship and feel sad at the thought of not seeing him anymore. He kept saying things like I can’t loose you, you’re my rock blah blah. What shall I do? What does it sound like he’s thinking?!

229,Hurting very badly,"I'll start at the beginning.   
A guy and I knew each other very well. We were very good friends. I moved overseas briefly and he was in the same city. We got very, very close. Had a lot of very vulnerable and intimate moments that weren't romantic or sexual.   
But then, we did get romantic. We spent a lot of time together. I had to move back home and he said he wanted to see where it went. And we remained close. Very close.   
He then called and said he couldnt do romance, that he had to focus entirely on his career. I said fine - we had many moments that weren't romantic and the friendship is what I valued immensely. He agreed. I asked if he was seeing anyone else - just so we could have transparency there. He said that was a cliche question to ask. He also said he cared about me ""so very much"".   
I ended up having to go back to the same city as him, and told him when I was coming. Got invited to his birthday lunch and he told me he was so excited to see me and catch up.   
But, when I turn up, he wont make eye contact with me. Barely gets up to hug me. And - the girl beside him is his date.   
I've never been more hurt. I feel completely used and discarded.  She's basically doing all the stuff I was doing to help his career - which I told him I still wanted to do because I enjoy it. Half the people at the lunch last saw me when we had been together and didnt realise we weren't.   


It feels like my chest has been crushed. He is someone I shared a lot of vulnerabilities with and got very close to. He did the same with me. Then he just...pulls away and ghosts me with all that history and all those broken promises.   


I cant deal with this. I dont know what to do. He was a bit of a lifeline in this city; my one very good friend. I am not coping. Please help me. ",love,1549766248,FemmeDarla,2,1,True,2019-02-09

231,We met in the 6th grade…,"  

It was my first day of school at SMS. I was use to being the new kid. I moved a lot, 8 elementary schools from K-5th grade, and this to be the third middle school in just my 6th grade year. Needless to say, I was use to not having friends by this point. In fact, I had never had any friends outside of my parents’ friends’ kids, or my similar aged cousins. Little did I know that was about to change.

I can’t remember what period it was, or who else was in our class with us, but I remember the day I walked into 6th grade science class and our eyes met. I knew right then and there that there was just something about you. Kindred spirits, two peas in a pod, and yet two strangers who hadn’t ever spoken a word to each other. I don’t remember the teacher introducing me or if I even introduced myself. All I remember is thinking “I hope I get sat next to him”. And what’ll ya know? That’s exactly where I was assigned. 

We became fast friends. Constantly passing notes, giggling about nothing, and making weird alien voices. Within days these antics got us separated, but that didn’t stop a thing because you were only moved to the desk right behind mine. Within a week or two you asked me to be your girlfriend. One of the happiest days of my life. To go from the kid with no friends and who had hardly spoken a word to anyone, outside of family and friends of, to having a best friend who I can be completely and utterly weird with, who also is now my boyfriend was inconceivable. I was elated.

Unfortunately, within a few weeks of us going out my dad got wind that I had a boyfriend, and being a 11-12-year-old girl with a boyfriend is apparently a no-no in dad’s eyes. So obviously he wanted to know more about this mysterious boy I started dating within the first two weeks of starting a new school in a new town. Instead of asking me, he asks my cousin, who is in the same grade and has been in the same school with him a little bit longer. She proceeds to tell him “he’s a bad boy who smokes weed and gets in trouble a lot”. To say my dad was less than thrilled was an understatement. Obviously, an argument ensued which unfortunately ended with my dad forcing me to break up with you. I, in my young life, had never found myself in any awkward social situation let alone one where I had to break my best friends’ heart. Devastation overload. If I remember correctly I did it over the phone, it’s one of those things I think I just kind of blocked out over the years. PTSD maybe? Either way we weren’t as close anymore. I don’t know how you felt at the time but I was definitely heartbroken more than any preteen girl should have to be.

Fast forward a few years to 8th grade. We’re still friends but drifted apart some. You got a new girlfriend. She was pretty awesome, way cooler than me, and I was definitely jealous, but after the whole “my dad made me break up with you” I never tried to pursue anything further than friends. I wouldn’t have wanted to hurt you again. One Friday night we were at a firehouse dance. Your girlfriend wasn’t there (if I remember she was grounded?). I know it was wrong but I was definitely trying extra hard to talk to you but couldn’t muster the guts. At some point or another some classmates of ours had egged us on enough to slow dance after seeing us talking and flirting for half the night. It was glorious and also my first slow dance with a boy. My weekend was spent gabbing to my best girl friends about how happy I was and that I wished you didn’t have a girlfriend. Then came Monday. Apparently, these same classmates who had egged us on to begin with ran back and told your girlfriend that I “was all over you at the dance”. Which wasn’t necessarily a lie but I kind of felt like they did it on purpose to mess with me. Obviously this girl wasn’t happy with me. She confronted me in the locker room before gym. Telling me to “stay away from her man or she’ll kick my ass”. I kind of just ignored her, got my gym clothes on and went about class as usual. She shot me dirty looks the whole class period but never said another word. After class everyone heads back to next period. I’m walking and talking to a friend and the girlfriend runs up and jumps in front of her and I and starts saying something along the lines of “I’m not going to hit you but…” WHAM!! Next thing I know my left cheek is killing me, and I see her running down the hallway. Over the next couple years, we didn’t talk as much at all. “Hey how are ya?” in passing or seeing you with mutual friends when I came to visit my bestie, but aside from that our contact was virtually non-existent.

When I was about 17, I moved back to the area. One night you threw a party, I ended up there with some friends. You were already with a girl, so I wasn’t about to start a whole other drama in your life but once again we hit it off. We spent most of the night talking and eventually had the most amazing sex I had ever had. It was just like it was the first day we met. Laughing joking, getting drunk and high as teenagers do. Two peas in a pod we were once again. Maximum happiness level achieved. Except one thing. Your ex. This ex and I use to be friends once upon a time. Not exactly best friends but friends nonetheless. When she found out we were talking it was like a hurricane had hit. She did everything in her power to try and fight me or cuss me out or slander me in any way she could. It didn’t matter. You weren’t hers and you weren’t mine, but you kept me around and that was enough for me. After a while of us hanging out and doing the whole FWB thing I finally got the gusto to ask you if you wanted more. Much to my chagrin you told me you “didn’t think either of us were ready or at a point in our lives to settle down”. We were both still young and had a lot of party left in us, so while I was devastated, I understood and left it at that. It wasn’t too long after that I moved away again.

Years pass. We have our own lives we both have kids and what’ll ya know, you’re dating one of my best friends. I was in a relationship at the time but was definitely feeling some kind of way that my best friend would go out with my former lover. I let it be and was just glad that I was able to talk to you again and be friends. There was always an unspoken attraction between us. Many times we flirted with our eyes. Oh, how I longed to get you in a room alone so I could just rip your clothes off and take you away with me. That never happened though. I eventually end up getting out of my relationship and buying a house back home. Something was just driving me there. I just knew that was where I needed to be. Home. While I’m in the process of moving and getting situated. You and my best friend part ways. You start seeing someone else. She’s bitter but it’s whatever. I try to stay neutral because I’m friends with both of you. Until one night where she was being particularly cunty. I knew the situation because she was of course telling me all about it like it was some kind of accomplishment to be a bitch to you. I wasn’t exactly a fan. To be a supportive friend I texted you, told you if you ever needed a place to get away or a friend to talk to I was there and to hit me up any time. You told me you were on your way. I met you halfway to pick you up because you had already had a few drinks and I drove the rest of the way to my house. We stayed up, had a few more drinks and eventually you passed out on my bed. I thought long and hard about just passing out next to you. Waking up to see your honey brown eyes in the morning sun. To see you smiling at me the way you use to. I instead decided to do the right thing, considering you were in a relationship. I covered you up, turned off the lights and slept in the next room. The next morning, I drove you back to your truck, fully hating myself for being a responsible adult. I grew some balls and decided to text you later in the day and tell you how I wish I didn’t have to take you back to your truck. I wanted to bad to just have my way with you. And to my surprise you had the same feelings. I’m not sure how much it had to do with me or the new girlfriend just being crazy already but you broke it off with her. Over the next couple weeks, we texted and flirted non-stop. Hung out a few times and eventually had our way with each other. It was AMAZING. I felt like I was 17 again. Giddy and nervous. Those butterflies you stirred up in me had never really gone away after all these years. They were still there…

A few weeks into our newfound FWB type thing we were doing, I decided to ask the obvious question. We weren’t 16-17-year-old kids anymore. We’re 30 and have kids of our own now. I wanted to know if this was going to go anywhere. I asked and you gave me the vague “let’s just see where this goes”. I accept the answer for what it is and continue as if the question had never gotten asked. More weeks go by and our infatuation with each other just seems to grow and grow. We’re finding out new things about each other, we’re on the same page with virtually everything from parenting our kids to politics. Even literally finish each other’s sentences or word for word say the same thing at the same time. We’re so in sync it’s like were the same person. We’re both loving it. Not too long after, it’s official. We’re a couple again. After nearly 20 years the boy I felt head over heels for the instant I saw him was finally mine… except one small thing. My friend, the ex. She was none to happy with any of this. I was obviously labeled as a two-faced backstabbing traitor cunt. Fine I’ll accept that. It was a generally shitty thing for me to do. But I regret nothing. Not. One. Damn. Thing. She treated you like shit for years, and ended up being a scumbag in the end. Sorry, not sorry.

As our love continues to bloom and we deal with baby mama drama, eventually the dust settles a bit and we’re able to carry on as a (Mostly?) normal couple. The holidays come and go, you’re basically moved in with me, life is good. Then one day we decide to get fucked up and go on a night walk in the middle of the night. It was awesome. We walked around and talked for hours. Just you and I. It was getting to be the wee hours of the morning and was going to rain, so we started back toward the house. Before we go inside you pull me over to you, hug me so tight, and tell me you have a question for me. It starts to rain pretty hard. You take my hand and drop something into it, and ask me to marry you. I (shocked) look in my hand and see a ring from my jewelry box, tears well and the biggest YES I could ever yell comes out with tears of pure joy followed by a long kiss in the hard rain as the sky starts to lighten. It was beautiful. The happiest moment of my life had just happened and I was literally over the moon and beyond… We head back in from the rain and get all dried up, do all the cuddles and stay up the rest of the night just enjoying each other. In the morning as we get ready for the day, I am just in awe of the fact that I am engaged to the most amazing human I have ever met in my life. We joke about how we should just go elope. This joke quickly goes from a joke to “where can we get married TODAY”. I google around and while our state had a 2-day waiting period, one a couple hours away had same day marriages. So, we call around get all the info we need and set out on our mission. It was glorious. Running from courthouse to law office and back to the courthouse like we were on some crazy Lord of the Rings quest. I don’t even remember most of what the officiator said, not sure if you do either. All I know is I just wanted him to get on with it so I could kiss you and finally be your wife… The best day of my life was made even better.

After nearly 20 years, I am overjoyed, elated, ecstatic, \*fill in a million synonyms here\* and just overall happy that on the 16th of this month we will be celebrating our 1 year wedding anniversary. Everything we’ve been through, everything we’ve done, the good times and the bad it was all worth it… I’ve been looking for the words to tell you how I feel for a long time… I don’t know that those words exist… what I do know, is that you’re the only man I have ever truly loved, and the only one that has ever loved me so completely. You truly are one of a kind. Happy 1 year anniversary, I love you &lt;3

236,I matched with my crush on bumble.... HELPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP,"So I saw him at the orientation, thought he's weird. Then we had same classes and I found him super funny and nice, and I ended up liking him secretly. I do have his phone number, even though we had three conversation about classes. Then during the winter break,  I found him on tinder. I didn't know how super like works so I super liked him and then nothing happened which made me very upset:( 

Then new semester began and we have 2 lectures together and we sit somewhat close and I just felt awkward and tried stop looking at him but i couldn't. I felt bad every time I look at him because he is my first crush ever. 

Anyway, I got bumble yesterday because I found tinder is mostly for hookups and it's kinda hard to deal with the sexual pickup lines I received. I was going to get match instead of tinder, but I found bumble and it looked like its more for mature relationship. Then I started swiping and I RAN INTO MY CRUSH AGAIN!!! I was so scared to swipe right cause i already got rejected (At least this is how i felt) on tinder when i gave him super like. What if he reject me again? I ended up swiping right thinking here goes nothing. I seriously took about seven minutes just trying to swipe. And guess what, we matched. 

Now at first, I felt so happy. Then I was like what if this is just a mistake he made? I mean i do that a lot on tinder and bumble. So I haven't sent the first message. Should I send him message or act like it never happened??? I probably will have lots of same classes with him in the future and I don't want awkward relationship with him. I'll be totally being friends with him. Now I'm kinda lost on what I'm trying to say but PLZ GIVE ME ADVICES",love,1549776165,yuran0925,0,1,True,2019-02-10

238,Am I making a very big and expensive mistake?,"Hi, I'll tell you my situation, and I'll be very honest. I know it's a long story and it will take two minutes, but I'm honestly quite desperate right now and don't know what to do, and for me it's quite a big decision: 

&amp;#x200B;

So last year I (23,m) was on a language exchange programme in an English-speaking country. There I met a girl(19,f), and we dated for two weeks until she broke up with me. She broke up with me because I was too needy. She was my second girlfriend and let's say that I had a history of bad luck with women (which is my fault, because I was too needy). 

I thought about breaking up with her before she did it, because she became avoidant like after one week. (I know those time frames sound crazy short, and they are, but I just tell it like it is). I didn't do it because I thought she just needed some space, so I give it to her, and a few weeks later she broke up with me. I was sad, of course, but handled it better than I thought. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then we did something as ""friends"", with other people, and there she kissed me and cried when she did so. Then we were again ""together"" for one week until I left back home. After that she became very avoidant again and it really hurt me. It hurt me over a long period of time, much more than when she broke up with me. At first I thought that she broke up with me because of the distance (I live 10 flight hours away from her), but when she broke up with me the first time (after the two weeks), she said that she had also done if I would live ""near"" her. So the distance is not an argument.

&amp;#x200B;

(Btw I was her first ""real"" boyfriend, but she had things with other boys before. (so for one night)

&amp;#x200B;

Then, last October we started texting again, and she showed interest after a while. She asked me a lot of personal questions (and I also her), and she also said I should come visit her. So on the 1st of January, we kind of ""started dating"" (although it's over long distance), and I booked a flight to come visit her in April. But since around three weeks, she became very avoidant. She didn't ask ANY questions anymore (like not a single one). Btw we only write each other maybe five times a day on average, sometimes a few days not at all, and I am always the one to initiate contact. I tried to talk about interesting things (interesting in her eyes), and also some ""games"". So last week we got to the point (playing) that she was a teacher, and if she would also give ""private lessons"" (you know what I mean), and she just answered ""nah"". 

&amp;#x200B;

She also said that ""we have to meet each other again because we probably changed a lot"", so that's quite obvious.

&amp;#x200B;

So yesterday we played ""Would you rather ... or..."", because there she HAD to ask me sth, even though it's something stupid, but maybe it could be a hidden message. So when I asked a question and told her ""okay, now it's your turn :)"", she just replyed 3 hours after that ""hahaha my battery died, sorry"". Like she didn't even ask a question after that. I wrote ""no problem haha, so what's your question?"", and right now I'm waiting for an answer. I think this answer will determine if I cancel my flight or not. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, sorry for the very long thread, but to those who made it through the End: Do you think that it is a good idea to visit her. It costs a lot of money (which is not the main problem) but also a lot of nerves. I am afraid to be very hurt, and it already hurts me since some time. And I don't want to travel to the other end of the world just to get hurt. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would help me, no matter what. ",love,1549796401,macpad095,15,1,True,2019-02-10
239,What should I do on Valentine’s Day?,"So valentine is coming soon and I have no idea what to do because my relationship is actually quite unclear. So I’m 17 and my girl or crush whatever you wanna call it is also 17. It’s a long story but in early December I expressed my feelings for her and I got told she also likes my as more than a friend but she wasn’t ready to jump into a relationship then. It has gone almost 3 months now and I know she still isn’t ready for a relationship but there was no hesitation that she still likes me.
During this time for when I told her my feelings and till today we have hade some nights watching movies and cuddling so on. Also then we have kissed a bit each time, last time two weeks ago it actually was a lot of kissing. It so hard for me to think of what I could do for her on Valentine’s Day since she doesn’t yet want a relationship I’ve got told, and I told her so on that I would give her time and not push her, and on these nights like last 2 week ago she is the one going in for kissing me. It confuses me a little but I know that she likes me but I don’t want to be to cheeky or how I’m supposed to say it on valentine, cause we don’t kiss regularly, only when we have chilled together watching movies. One thing I thinked of is that I will leave her a little cute card with some cute words from me on her car “it is parked away from other people so it will stay there” since she starts work before me so I’ll go and leave it there on my break since I have work at least an hour longer than her. You think I should do anymore than that? Our relationship is just so confusing I don’t know what to do or if that’s enough

241,I fell for my bestfriend of 9 years.,"I won't lie. It wasn't sudden. Rather it was continuous over time. We text daily each other as long as we are awake, send our ugly selfies to each other, tell each other everything, talk over calls for 2-3 hours daily, know each others secrets to the core, etc. The connection we share cannot be explained in mere words. We fall sick together, happy things happen to us together. Also we had an accident in an span of 30mins and got admitted to the same hospital because apparantly the place of accident was the same. I've seen her both at her best and worst. You get the idea. Sure we had our share of fights as well but we always came back to each other crying. So much so we hugged each other crying one time and I slept on her shoulder. You get the idea.

I am just confused now, is she the one? Is she the person I will be most happy with forever. She always tells me how marrying your best friend is the best possible relationship ever and gives me examples. I don't know, I'll be going off to work in couple of months and will return after 2 years. I am not able to connect the things together.

I am 24 and I've been in any relationship ever. It's just that I just know, I won't find somebody like her anywhere anymore. The chemistry of 9 years cannot be made in 9 days or months or even 1 or 2 years. Is this what love feels like. I never delt like this before.

249,How do I talk to the girl I like even though she’s no longer in a class of mine?,Ok so for about a year I’ve had a crush on girl in high school which I’m in right now. We meant each other last school year. Last semester I had social studies class with her which made easy enough to be able to talk to her even though sometimes I was a little shy but we still talked and we’re pretty cool with each other overall even though clearly I would like to be more. Anyways now the semester changed and I don’t have any classes with her anymore. However her 3rd period class which is the one right before lunch for the both of us is right down the hallway from me and I see her walk out of the class everyday and sometimes walk in there as well. I’m happy that even though I don’t have any classes with her that I can still see her everyday but I really want to find a way to keep talking to her and I was already shy when I had a class with her and now I’m just as shy if not more so. Also we both have the same lunch and I want to talk to her there but she’s generally eating lunch with her friends and I don’t want it to be awkward or anything like that. So I’m asking a few questions here I guess. 1. How can I approach her and talk to her even though it’s outside of a classroom? 2. Would it be awkward if I tried to talk to her? And 3. What would be a good way I could start talking to her or like start a conversation cause I could do it inside of a classroom but don’t really know how outside of one.,love,1549834225,Savagemode21send,1,1,True,2019-02-10

It is important to make **true love** of the relationship to someone who is harmed by family or to a friend Now you have to know exactly how true is the profit, so you should know what it is like to be a relationship with someone else 

 

### True love definition

A relation is what we are relating to the person we are having a relationship with, how much we can not stay connected to the person, we have not been able to show love over and above love.  


### Now you can ask questions in your mind that what is heart? or what is my mind?

Do we understand the difference between heart and mind, we can say that we talk about differences in most cases but we can understand that the difference is different. We say that I want to do today I will do it today I will eat it, what is the episode? Have we ever thought of what I said? Whether we have taken it in our life, or in our minds, in most cases our mind gives us the right answers, but you probably do not know our minds often answer incorrectly.

267,"My boyfriend has ""fallen out of love"". What do I do?","My boyfriend and I met 2,5 months ago and we started our relationship after 2 weeks. We had a really good connection and we were completely crazy about each other. I have to admit, we went really fast. We had just had 2 dates when we started our relationship, and after just 2 weeks I was celebrating Christmas with his family (not planned, my own family screwed up and I really didn't want to be alone). He slept over at my place every weekend, from Friday till sunday and we saw each other a lot during the week. He is 27 years old and I am 21, but that never was an issue.

Yesterday, he told me that he didn't feel that spark anymore (after just 2 months!!) and he thoughts we should break up. He didn't want to hurt me, so he didn't want to keep trying and then realising it wasn't working anyway. I asked him why he didn't feel that spark anymore and he said that he really needed some ""me-time"", and he felt a bit suffocated by constantly being together and doing everything together. I have to admit, I also felt a bit suffocated; I had no weekend to myself and I also reaaaly needed some time alone. During the week we are very busy with work and I am still studying, so the weekend is really the online time off we have. And then we are together, so we have 0 free-time to ourselves. I tried to explain to him that that is not necessarily a bad thing and does not mean that we have fallen out of love, but we just need some time apart. 

So now, we decided to take a step back and start ""dating"" again. So just normal contact during the week, but not 24/7 texting, and only seeing eachother on fridayevening. No sleeping over, just regular dates.

All of my worries fade away and it feels like everything is good in the world. Also, I have bad anxiety and he’s really good at making me feel better.

270,It's fucking complicated. I'm in love and it is.... complicated.,"I am 36 years old, twice divorced, long hard road behind me, academic.

She is 33 years old, twice divorced, long hard road behind her, six kids.

I met her when I was 15 (and she obviously was 12)

For a few months, we hated each other. One day we fought, became best friends. Not quite a year together - I moved.

Didn't see her for a few years after that. I went to the Navy, came back, found her. Spent a few hours together, haven't seen each other since. That was 2002. We've spoken three times since then, and just got back in touch. Our lives have been eerily similar... like seriously seriously eerily similar. We've both known since 2007 that we've been in love/infatuation/whatever (infatuation doesn't tend to last 20 years) since the late 90's. The connection is freaking voodoo. She is 1000 miles away (almost exactly).

The thing? Her adoptive mom divorced my dad in 05 or 06. Yeah. I met her when my dad married her mom. It's that kind of post.

No, we were not ""raised together."" No, dumbass, it isn't ""illegal"", no ""the bible"" does not condemn it. No, we are not ""family"" (though we were, once). She isn't my sister, but she kinda was once - for like a minute.

My half sister whom I have never met is 20, who is her ""sister"" by virtue of being the daughter of my dad and her adoptive mom, lives near her - they see each other all the time. My old step-mom, same. My dad even still lives in the same state (I think - never talk to that piece of shit). I have no contacts with my family, she has maintained continuous contact with a portion of them.

I am too fucking life-hardened to be feeling... love sick. I feel tenderness and concern for her. I care about her, I am incomprehensibly connected to her, and as this is Reddit I figure I can say that the conflict is only made more difficult by how... sexy I find her to be. If she is to be believed (two divorces make one cautious) the feelings are completely mutual. Very similar life experiences, business aspirations, interests, even the same goddamn sexual fantasies (which adds a weight that is difficult to bear - she hits me like someone I could love AND be super freaky with). I very much want to be with her.

I should note - I am a polymath. Offering me psychological/legal/ethical/moral/religious analysis is at best redundant. Life answers don't come from books - I'm looking for humans, not parrots. Also, I am not a child, teen, or twenty-something. Adults, please.

I am very much disinclined to speak with my therapist about this little gem. Yes, I know.

Another thing. She's got some things in her life that, were it anyone - ANYONE - but her, I'd have lost her number already. Not drugs, but things... things that could be bad. She's got six kids for god's sake. Messed up, but it's not even the number - I noticed I already care about them - it's how the hell I would provide.

Got me thinking like captain save-a-hoe, and that is not a ""healthy"" thing... no, not one bit. My stupid ass keeps responding with ""all is fair in love and war..."" My last divorce was 6 years ago (almost seven) and I've been on exactly 3 dates since - nothing. Honestly - I seriously started considering artificial women, but I simply can't bring myself to do that. I'm not ugly (at least, women say so) and I've got ""options"" - but they aren't any more attractive than a thermoplastic woman. Seriously ladies - look deeper than the eyeliner, most of you aren't offering much. I digress.

I have asked her to fly out to stay a couple of days - one night - my treat. She asked me the same thing - her treat. Spring break is coming, I very much want it to happen one way or the other. I also wish that I did not want it to happen.

I wish life would have been different in 2002, and neither of us would have two divorces - just a 16 year party.

I cannot fathom how very... Greek Tragedy this is. I cannot move to where she lives for a million reasons. Aside from that, I have no idea how I would cope with the first time I meet my half-sister (the 20 year old), I explain that her sister and I have been in love and totally separated for two decades. See my old step-mom again: ""Hi, &lt;name&gt; and I are in love, and intend to try to have a life together, hope it isn't weird that you used to fuck my dad."" 

Haven't a clue how her kids would cope with it - youngest is like 9, oldest is 14 I think. I'm not their uncle, just convolutedly attached to something uncle-ish. The fuck would they even call me? My name I imagine... One of her kids, saw a pic and listened to descriptions, I already have a deep caring for for a number of reasons... things I understand and wish some dude had helped me with. One of her kids is gay-ish and having to live with the stuff around that. One keeps getting in trouble... Twisted for me to think but, I'm actually well suited to being... exactly what kids in those situations would need... god knows I did, and never got it.

Fucking even having dad-ish compassion for the little mongrels I've never met. Find myself thinking how very much I would like to be a solid man for some kids... give them a place to feel safe and an adult ear. Can't fix them, but I can sure as hell love them and let them know they are never alone. Haven't a clue where that paternal desire came from.

And, I find myself having to manage the... delicious spite that I feel at how scandalized the others in my family would be if we were together - I do not come from a nice home. I try very hard not to be vindictive - especially around this.

Seriously? Why in God's name do I have to find myself in a fucking shakespearean script? 

I just... my best friend is a woman who wanted me a couple of years ago, but I didn't want her so I don't talk to her about things like this (I try to be sensitive to the people I love). My therapist would have all sorts of unhelpful things to say that I already know, and would not change what is. One friend just says ""be careful""... love her to death, but I was hoping for something... better.

Shit.

And 1000 miles is pretty far (Delilah... not so sordid as mine). I don't know if she's got the courage to move here (I own property, building a respectable career) and leave her... our family. I won't ask for any commitment... yet. It would be hard on her kids, but my opinion is it would be awesome for them... provided people don't come with pitchforks to kill the beast anyways. It's not like any of this is new or has to be decided now. 

I just.... am searching in vain on the world of Reddit to hear something useful.

I have no use for any derogatory comments. I have weathered storms that would flatten most people that I've met, so please don't hand me trite bullshit.

Yay the anonymity of online for letting me ask for anonymous feedback.

279,I'd never felt true unconditional love before him,"He's different from my other guy friends. He cares about me in a different way. He says he just wants to make sure I am ok. I have a lot going on right now. 

There's definitely an attraction but he doesn't act on it. I've never met a man like him. He doesn't want anything in return. He is steeling my heart and I can't help it. 

I care about him so much. It hurts to know I can't spend time with him because we live in separate states. The time we spent together recently made me feel weightless, which intimidated me so much that I froze. I couldn't even think. It was embarrassing. 

We are so similar in so many ways. I think he is struggling internally and all I want to do is talk with him, about everything. 

I feel so comfortable with him. I've never met a man that makes me feel so comfortable. My father and other men in my family are extremely uncomfortable. I married a man that I felt uncomfortable around at times, thinking it was normal, but then realized how abnormal it is so I'm currently going through a divorce. 

No man has consumed my mind as much as this friend. We've known eachother for years, I've always been attracted to him, but as a married woman with a strong moral compass I never allowed him to see how deeply I cared for and respect him. 

I have so many things to work through before I can even begin to think about connecting emotionally. I'm afraid to show him how much I care, because I don't want to lose him as a friend. 

I have tried to have open dialogue about the attraction, but he shut it down. It broke my heart. 

This feeling is one that I've never felt before. I know I shouldn't be focusing on him, but I can't help it.

280,Its been more than a year and i’m still starking his social medias (Advice),[removed],love,1549912678,bingbangbong76,0,1,True,2019-02-11
281,The first time I really feel,"I've always been a person who mostly kept to himself (21, M) and never really matured emotionally. I was a shy, introvert person for most of my life, partly due a difficult youth. I've been depraved of basic things like human touch, motherly love and affection in general. I struggled with my love life through highschool and the years following, always ended up heartbroken or unable to forge deep emotional connections with the opposite gender. About a year ago, I once again ended up in a failed attempt to find llve only to be heartbroken again. Leading to depressions and the idea that I'm simply unable to feel or experience genuine love. Until one night, where I reluctantly tagged along with friends to go to a party. At that party, I saw the most popular and pretty girl (22) from back in highschool. I overcame my anxiety and casually started chatting and flirting with her. Fast forward to now and we've been together for nearly 8 months!

I always thought this girl was way above my league, and maybe had a 'bad' personality as she is so beautiful and popular. She turned out to be a genuine sweet, smart and simply amazing girl. After all this time, I still feel like I'm floating on a pink cloud. Sure, we had ups and downs, some difficult times we came out stronger. This is the first time I don't feel 'in love' with someone, but feel true love and affection. This connection feels like it was predetermined by the universe. Our story is filled with so many coincidences. For example, she lives 200m away from where I lived the first 18 years of my life. She had a similar situation at home, she went to the same events years ago, her sense of humour complements mine, she went to that one party where we met to also forget about a previous  heartbreak, etc etc. It just feels like I've known her for all my life.

I can keep going on about her. The look on her face when I give her a present, her smile when we meet up, her annoying laugh, feeling her breath when she sleeps cuddled up against me. The way she looks at life makes me see things a lot more positive, her careless attitude makes me forget about my past problems. Thinking about how we've grown together compared to the start, how close we've become just makes me feel so warm, it makes me smile and almost tear up. She never stops amazing me. Long story short: I think I finally know what true love feels like.

But now she is going to study abroad for 6 months. This dreaded moment has finally arrived. I spent the last two days with her, and when the time came, she cried for almost hours and hugged me as if she'd never let go. The realization hadn't quite hit me yet. We study and live in dorms in the same city, and now I am back here. We used to spend so many great nights together here, when I got back here, it suddenly hit me I'd be alone for a long time now and simply burst out in tears, uncontrollably. Something I rarely do, in a way I never felt before. This isn't heartbreak, this is... love, but it still hurts a lot... I have to get used to this and it won't be easy, since I only moved here after we were together.

I just wanted to share this, because I'm so filled with emotions right now, again something I'm not used to. I never felt this before. And while it sucks, it kind of feels really good to actually have this, and to be able to feel this kind of feeling I thought I'd never feel. I feel alive because of it, I feel alive because of her. I'd love to read similar experiences, or anyone who wants to share a word. ❤️",love,1549913988,hhansh,2,1,True,2019-02-11

He knows me like no one else. Has he hurt me? Has he rattled my chains? Has he caused me to see a lot of damn ugly parts of myself? Yesss. But he’s shown me the most beautiful parts too. No one can see that though. Not even my family, my “friends”—all they saw was a struggling artist that thought he was too good to work in a factory. They figured he was the reason for “my issues”. He wanted more for me. He knew my job didn’t make me happy, he knew I was sheltered and limited, and all he wanted was for me to be happy. Maybe I want that too, still. But I broke up with him. Things began getting toxic; I found myself clinging to him when I should be clinging to myself, and he felt like an animal in a cage and I knew it. We always know what each other are feeling. I know it sounds rediculous but I really think he’s the one despite everything we have been through. Now I’m talking to him in secret because no one would be happy with me. But I love him.

290,A lesson in Iowa love.,"Rusted Fenders and Torn interiors plague trucks in Iowa. The road salt corrodes all paint and metal at some point. But these trucks are far from neglected. These trucks are cared for like children (loved like them too). Ritual maintenance and repairs, often done by the drivers, keep these trucks on the road well after 300,000 miles. Living in Iowa and working on trucks taught me that we aren’t much different from the trucks we own. No matter what someone is going through  or what they’ve done it’s just rust. Something to be left in the past. Rust can be left. Sure - it’ll keep rusting, but it doesn’t matter. Under the rust and broken paint is someone beautiful who will always be there. Someone Who is reliable and worth loving. Like trucks, if you regularly maintain yourself and the people you love, rust will never stop you. And if you’ve broken down and think you’re beyond repair, you’re not. With enough time and hard work, no matter how much rust you will always start up and keep going.

292,Playing video games with my girlfriend might be the best thing ever.,"With Valentine's Day on the way, I thought I'd suggest something that would make lots of couples happy. If you really wanna make your boyfriend happy, let him show you the world of gaming. I'm serious, this is the most special thing you can do for a guy. And it's free!



Ever since I met my girl 2 years ago, I've been getting her more and more into gaming. At first I didn't think she'd care, but what do I know - she loves it! In fact, now she often wants to game more than me! It's a miracle! And a dream come true. My favorite person in the world has the same passion as me!



The feeling of laying with her in the dark, her head on my shoulders and the screen light hitting us while we go through adventures together and laugh is just amazing. Experiencing different emotions together and kissing on every loading screen... having racing or fighting competitions and thinking of rewards for the winner... it's all such a cozy and sweet experience!



Today we played Hitman and everyone who's played it knows that it can be a pretty challenging game. So when we finished a mission with a high score it felt so good! Because we did it together. When I was stuck, she thought of something and when she was stuck, I figured stuff out. And everytime we did, we fist bumped because we felt like real partners.

I didn't want to disturb him, (he works nights, and I try to understand difference in sleep schedule). I went downstairs and took a nap on the couch. Well, I ended up having a sleep paralysis dream soon after. In my dream I heard him coughing, my instinctive reaction was to walk up the stairs to go soothe him. As soon as I reached the top step, I
tumbled down and woke up in my dream on the couch. I found myself in a panic, unable to move and unable to awaken. This repeated itself a couple times. When I finally woke, my heart was racing and I was sweating profusely. I ran upstairs hearing him coughing, and gave him a big hug. He told me he was so happy that I was there and that he loved me. I've never been so happy to nurture someone. He felt great at the end of the day. Now I'm getting sick, but it was worth a nice day with him. ",love,1549945669,ddankkddanii,1,1,True,2019-02-11
296,What is love?,"I don’t think anyone truly knows. Its an abstract concept that no one can prove or disprove. But personally, I think love is characterized by 5 things:

Accepting. 100% honesty and vulnerability

Selfish. But benevolent... it’s wanting the best for another because it would hurt you otherwise.

Physiological. A series of chemical reactions--From high increase in dopamine to unusually low serotonin levels, you are affected both emotionally and physically.

Unlimited. There is no cap and you will never reach the bounds because there are none. 

You. Automatic. Your heart continuously pumps blood through your veins because it wants you to live; a constant desire to survive &amp; thrive. Love begins with Your body: pumping blood thru your veins, breathing air, sustaining life. Then love moves to your mind. Self-discipline, maintaining control, creating your own happiness. Only now, is it possible for love to move on to the external world.

300,I met the love of my life when he messaged the wrong girl,"On July 5th it will be three years since I received that fateful message that changed my life. I a [15F]  finished work at my cafe job in the afternoon and as I waited for my mother to pick me up I responded to my notifications.  I was a bit confused when I saw a message from a random boy [17M] because I hardly ever got those types of messages. Even weirder the boy was asking me if I had had wisdom teeth removal surgery that morning. I thought he was a bit weird   but he explained to me that he had seen a girl in the recovery room who had looked like me; he thought she was pretty and exactly his type (be mindful he was high as a kite at the time). He said he needed to find this girl and searched his facebook friends list finding me. Of course I was not the girl who he was speaking of and I told him that. I was fully prepared to just not respond to him and delete his messages because of stranger danger but after some research I quickly realised that he did truely exist.  We continued to talk because boy can that man hold a conversation and he’s very charismatic. But continuing to talk was the best decision I ever made... 

We quickly discovered we had lived three streets away from each other for years and had friends we both knew. We were so close but never crossed paths. The best twist of fate I reckon is the fact that his surgery got postponed to a few weeks later than originally planned. 

We have been together 3 years in August and I can honestly say this man is my soulmate. We have been completely inseparable since that day. I didn’t find the greatest man, he found me and I cannot wait to grow old together. 

I have never been so sure about something in my life than I have him. Our friends see it, our family and most importantly we see how incredible our relationship is when we support, encourage, be thoughtful, respectful and communicate with each other. 

He is my best friend and I love him dearly. ",love,1549970920,HHaga00,0,1,True,2019-02-12

305,Love dont wait in line,"So I met a girl on tinder! I saw that she was a girl that likes to work out so i checked out her Instagram and saw her before and after photos and i started talking to her with that in mind! 

I also admired her smile so i told her that too! 
She said; well if you like my smile, add me on Snapchat so that i can show you more of it

And so i did! 

We started talking more and more! And i found out that we had very much in common! 
And before i knew it i wanted to give it a shot and see what more life had to offer for the two of us! 

A short while after we started talking she stopped talking to me out of nowhere! After two days i asked whats up and she said that she was kinda into someone else! 

And i accepted it, i asked if we could get to know eachother anyway, she said yes! 
Time went by and we got to know eachother more

One weekend she visited a friend of her in my city, they went out and so did i! I met her for the first time, and God what a beauty! I instantly fell in love with her! 
And we talked for hours! And she told me.. she also had feelings for me, so she didnt know whether to stay with the other guy or what! 

I didn’t really know how to react! But I knew that I had a chance and I didn’t wanna let it go

So after that weekend we started talking even more, and I visited her a weekend 
We went out and things happened! We didn’t go all the way but we were close!

The day after she told me she had to figure it out, she needed some time! 
Two weeks after I found out that the guy she liked went home with another girl! 
I invited her to my place so that I could cook for us! I told her about the other guy after I drove her home! 
The day after I invited her over again and did the same thing! But then things happened again and we went all the way! 


Two weeks later she visited her friend and they went out! She came home with me that night and the following morning she realized that she couldn’t date the other guy so she decided to give it a shot with me! 

We dated for a month until two weeks ago, she visited her friend again, I was away at work so I couldn’t join them out! 
She met the other guy, and they ended up sharing bed that night! Nothing happened tho, at least that’s what she said 


And noooow she is wondering whether to try and see if we can keep going forward with our relationship or if she wants to stay single! 
She said she won’t go back to the other guy cus there’s nothing to go back for but she still has feelings for him! I guess it’s because they never really got any closure? 

She said she needs some time to focus on herself 
And I don’t know what to do! I really like this girl! 
When we talk now I kinda get the feeling she’s trying to make me leave her! She ignores a lot of the things I say and our conversations aren’t what they used to be!

I want to give her the time she’s asking for but it’s heave asf considering I don’t know what’s on her min and for how long that I have to wait! Everyday I want to ask what she wants but I don’t wanna rush her into making a decision!

306,Short but Sweet...,"  Today marks the end of my almost relationship... I know going in that my chances where slime but it felt right, we walked and the night transformed into the morning where I wanted nothing more but stay there with you lying next to you taking it in enjoying what could come of our meet. But I knew something was wrong I felt it not when we were together but when we were apart. The second time we got together I got out of hand and pulled a Ted Mosby and under the influence of good time and good company I told you I loved you… I meant it, although I told you I was just alcohol rushing through my veins. But you still stayed with me, much later then what I though 8 become 9 and then 10 soon it was 1 and we just laid there conversing and feeling the warmth off one another. I was worried that it would be the last time I would see you the last time I would feel your lips against mine… But it wasn’t that was left to the last night of the year. I planned a quick night of lights and joy, but of course what I plan cannot go right, you got held up and showed up right when the park closed, so we meet at pool hall, there we had our talk you told me we couldn’t be together at that time. I told you I understood and that I would only treat you as a friend and nothing more, that I would not over step, but you brought me in close and kissed me that night, become a night of forbidden passion we knew we shouldn’t have but we kept pushing it and pushing it… We danced, we laugh, we loved, but when Garth Brooks If Tomorrow Never Comes came on and that line “ I lay awake and watch her sleeping, she lost in peaceful dreams so I turn off the lights and lay there in the dark , and the though crosses my mind if I never wake up in morning would she ever dough the way I feel about her in my hearts” I sung that to you and when our eyes meet I told you we had to go, that it was too much to be there with that song, although it was only two mornings we spent together it was more to me than any I have ever had… We separated and walked away, but meet in the parking lot, we did not want to part, all we wanted was to just stay there all night, but I knew that if we entered the new year together the inevitable would kill me… the month after I tried the distant friend thing but I wanted more, I always did, but it was a moot point you were done, Today I got your dreaded text, I wanted to see you I invited you to dinner, and you told me, “I’d rather keep it in a friend setting from now on if that’s okay.” I told you it was but it’s not, not for me I must distance myself I must just walk away destroy any connections I have to you, I want us to happen, but I must respect your wishes, I must for your happiness not be a part of anything anymore. I will cherish those few moments we spent together, the hope and joy you brought into my life for how ever short it was. I would not give it up the opportunity to get to know you and spend time with you the memories we made it was worth it. I wish you the best and you know that if you ever need me I’ll be there no matter what. I am glad you know what you want and that you are perusing it, I am happy that you know this isn’t what you want instead of years down the road, you are a very special women that is doing amazing things with such great hopes and ambitions.

I love him so much.,"The only person who has ever made me want them like this, is you. I truly have never been sexually attracted to anyone other than you, I thought there was something wrong with me because I never had interest in anything physical. But you got to know me. You turned my heart on first, you respect me, you treat me so well, you inspire me, you made my world more beautiful. And it surprised me when this side of me made an appearance! I want you to know that you’re the only man I’ll ever want in this way and in every way. You’re the sexiest, most wonderful person alive in my eyes.

322,Why am I (F20) still hopelessly in love with my (F21) ex-girlfriend?,"Everything about our relationship was wrong. From the start we bonded over our depression and spent most of our time drinking and fighting. This lasted for three years until I followed her to college and she resented me passionately for it. We were high school sweethearts (a little unconventional), but I can strongly say that she was one of the greatest things to ever happen to me. We had a rough ending and I ended up leaving the college the next semester. Now she’s in Spain and we talk a few times a week. We both have a lot of mental health issues so we like to check in and she recently attempted to commit suicide. I don’t really want anything to happen again because I know it will only end in heartbreak, but I still can’t help but wish it could work out.

325,Should I ask this girl out?,"Normally, I would ask somebody out, but given the circumstances, I'm scared it'll come off as creepy or unwelcome and I'm not sure I want to go ahead with it. I'm in my third year of college and she is a sophomore. I always thought she was really attractive and pretty, but lately I have developed something like a crush on her. The catch is this: we have never spoken and we don't have any common classes or friends that will let me talk to her. But I have a feeling, she is interested in me as well. She's caught me sneaking glances her way many times and I too have found her checking me out at the gym or at the cafeteria when I'm not looking. 

We have a sign in/sign out system sorta thing in our uni, where we need to scan our id cards everytime we are leaving campus. It's kinda irritating because you have to do it EVERYTIME, even if you're going out to buy gum or get a cup of coffee. If you don't have your id card, then you have to type out your student id onto the computer at the gate. I can for the life of me never remember my student id. So this one time, I wanted to go out but realised I don't have my id card. I tried to sneak past the security guard and he asked me to queue up and type it out like I'm supposed to. Just then, this girl (lets call her O) comes with a bunch of friends to sign out at the gate. She sees what's happening and proceeds to sign out. But since, I kinda came before her, I guess she wanted me to go first and sign out before her. Since I was standing right behind her, she turned around and looked at me and tried to say something. But we both ended up staring blankly at each other and got awkward, and she quickly signed out and left. Once we were outside, I met up with my friends and saw that she was buying something at this departmental store. This one friend was pushing in a way that screamed ""dude go talk to her"" and I noticed that she saw that and quickly turned her head away. Fast forward to a few days later, I am at the cafeteria with two friends and she queues up right behind me. We exchange awkward glances again and as I'm standing there, I hear her singing something softly. That was it...nothing more, I simply took my food tray and left. 

&amp;#x200B;

So it's Valentine's Day and our uni has this thing, where we can send each other cards without disclosing our identity. I decided to send her a card. I wrote something along the lines of, ""hey, I think you're really attractive. You have these almond shaped eyes and a stunning smile, you're really beautiful. Don't know how you are in person, but I am sure you must be really nice and cool. Happy V-Day! Maybe one day, I can finally muster up the courage to ask you the time or something!"" Now, I don't know whether she'll realise it's me. There's a slim chance she will, and there's no way I can approach her. I see her at the gym the every other day, but it's a uni gym and to strike up conversation like that could seem a little desperate. So what do you guys think I should do?

330,Young love :),"Sorry if formatting is strange, I’m on mobile. 

I’m only 19 and my girlfriend 18. We met and started dating when I was 11. I get incredible backlash from my family at times because they feel our love isn’t valid because we are so young and we are a gay couple. Her only family is her grandma who raised her after her mom died when she was 7 and her father has severe schizophrenia. Her other grandma and grandpa live two cities away. We basically grew up together in this small town. We were kinda off and on for a few years which exacerbates their notion that we won’t make it.

There weren’t always good times and loving moments. There were fights and crying and emptiness. Mistakes were made and we were once cold to one another. We spent time pursuing other people.  

At the end of this month we are getting the keys to our first home after living in an apartment for a year! We’ve conquered countless problems and stumbled through the many mazes of life on a scantly budget and I feel our love is stronger than any of those I’ve seen in my family. 

I’ve had doubts in our relationship I’m hesitant to say, but with her I feel like a giant dripping with confidence. I am my best and most productive self around her and she keeps me in line because it’s easy for me to get into trouble sometimes. 

She’s an emotional fountain and sometimes i have to help her keep a level head. She’s incredibly stunning, honest and loyal. She has captivating and fascinating opinions, and always asks me questions that catch me off guard thus leaving me to google it. (knowledge is power!) Because of her I don’t know the problems of modern teenage relationships because she’s so good to me and she works hard for our future together. 

My friend says getting a house changes everything, I don’t know what that means but I think we make an awesome team and we’re both nervous and excited to see what the future has in store for us. 

There is true love.
There is hope. 

Thanks for reading stranger :)

I started talking to this girl at the beginning of freshman year, as she was in a few of my classes, we talked a lot (we still do) we talked about each other’s days, she always asked me for the homework and for help and I would always help her because I thought she was so cute and beautiful. We would text before bed and say goodnight and stuff like that, I started really liking her because she made me so damn happy. I never cared about people’s bodies or wanting someone because of their body. I wanted her because I was sad and lonely. until I met her, and I became happy again.  We talked for months and Next thing I know, she’s dating my best friend. We still talk a lot, but it feels different knowing she isn’t single anymore. She told me she felt like a jerk for dating him. I said it’s okay as long as she’s happy. I’m sad again. With nobody. Nothing. Nobody else makes me feel that way.

344,We met in the 6th grade... (Part 2),"[Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/ap02vc/we_met_in_the_6th_grade/)

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t remember much else about the day I met my you, but I’ll never til the day I die forget seeing you walk in to the classroom on the first day. There was a certain sparkle in your eyes. Over the next couple days, I remember passing endless notes and joking around, making alien voices. I always felt a bit weirder then most kids and yet with you I felt like maybe I wasn’t. Within days of you coming to my school I asked her out. Wasn’t long before your more straight-laced cousin had told your family about me and that was the end of it. Due to the fact neither of us really wanted to end it we stayed friends and would still talk.

Fast forward from 6th grade to 8th, and I have a new girlfriend. Although I was dating someone, I was still friends with you, and to be honest, still liked you. At a dance one night that my girlfriend couldn’t make it to, you and I, after a night of making eyes at each other and being egged on, decided to slow dance. I know it was wrong of me but I would be lying if I said it didn’t feel right. That Monday at school later in the day as I walked through the hallway, my girlfriend storms past me without saying a word. I a stupid young guy had no idea why she was upset. Shortly after I learn its because she found out about the dance and had punched my you. Amazingly after all this I’m still able to remain friends with you and somehow my girlfriend as well. Sadly, though we were still no closer to being together. 

After all the drama of middle school we remained friends. High school came and we dated different people yet always seemed to have the same or overlapping social circles. When I was 17, you hadn’t been living in the area for a while, and I had no phone or car so sadly I hadn’t seen or heard much from you for some time. One weekend I was having a weekend long party. I had some friends come over the first night and ended up having a bit of a fling with a girl I met that night. The next night comes and a mutual friend of mine had told she was gonna come out to the party and that she had you with her. As soon as I heard that I didn’t give the girl from the night before a second thought. So, from the instant you arrived it was like you were the only thing I was focused on. After a night of drinking we finally had our first kiss, and well, first everything for us. I know by this point I probably sound bad but the reality is from the moment I saw you there has never been a moment that I wouldn’t drop anything or anyone to be with you. I remember running my fingers down your back and just being in heaven looking at your smile.

That night was the start of what I can’t remember if was days or weeks of us together. At one point you had asked me what we were or where it was going. Foolishly I told you that I wasn’t sure we were ready to be serious. I said this for a combination of reasons. At the time I was still kinda coming out of something serious, and you were very much a free spirit, to the point I was almost intimidated by you. I was scared if I told you I wanted something serious it would scare you off. Unfortunately, that caused the end of our time together. Shortly after I got back together with my ex (which I later regretted). So here we were again having ended but on good terms, still sharing several mutual friends.

Over the next ten years a lot happened, and well, life happened. You had moved away again and although I would still hear about you through friends, rarely got to talk to you. We both ended up in serious relationships and having kids. My girlfriend of the time and you were longtime friends and would keep in touch but both of our SO’s hated the idea of us talking to each other. Due to that, our communication was very limited because we were both with very jealous and insecure people. You and your SO had split up and you were actually buying a house back in the area. At the time I didn’t see it as an opportunity but was very happy for you. You were the first one of our friends to buy their own home, on top of a handful of other accomplishments that same year. I was very proud of you. Around the same time this was happening I had also decided to leave the toxic relationship I was in. It was a messy breakup and my ex was very psychotic. Three months later I begin dating a girl and staying with her. I knew it was a rebound thing with little to no potential but it was a happy change…….at first. She quickly started showing signs of jealousy and began complaining about me having female friends. That was annoying me already as I had just gotten away from some of these same problems. Well, one night after seeing my kids I had went out drinking. When I got home, I dreaded going inside. I sat in my truck for probably a half hour debating what to do or if I even wanted to go in then or ever. As I’m sitting in my truck, outta no where you text me. You had heard about the crazy breakup and all I was dealing with with my ex. You text me and said “if you ever need somebody to talk to or just need somewhere to get away just call me”. Mind you we weren’t currently talking really at all. I text you back right away and said that your timing couldn’t be better. So, without hesitation I started my truck back up and was on my way. 

We sat back and talked and smoked and laughed. Even after not really talking or hanging out alone in years, there we were like we hadn’t missed a beat. I drank too much and passed out on the foot of your bed without having really planned to. I woke up the next morning to realize you had covered me up and slept in the other room. Within moments of waking up you came in and it was amazing waking up to see your smile. I had things to do so I had to leave not long after. We text back and forth all day. That night I went home and my girlfriend of the time started with her crap and tried to say I needed to pick between her and my kids. I laughed and said “bye Felicia!”. That was that, I packed up and left right then. Well over the next couple days you and I continue texting and talking nonstop. To be honest at the time so much time had passed and I still felt like you were outta my league. With that in mind despite how much we were talking I hadn’t even figured I had a shot. Luckily, you were brave and had text hinting that you were bummed I fell asleep so soon. I was blown away thinking that I actually still had a shot.

You were always that girl who wasn’t afraid to be different and I loved you for it. You were a free spirit with a sparkle in her eyes that I don’t ever know that I’ll find the words for. Kinda like that beautiful and innocent look of curiosity and wonder in a child’s eyes, idk. You've just always been one of those people that ""if you don’t like her……its you"". You have this way of always making me feel like we’re kids again. 

So as the next time I came over to your house, we had a couple drinks and talked and laughed and then it happened. After ten years there you were in my arms again. Again, feeling like we had never skipped a beat. The next morning was the first time I had ever woke up with you in my arms. To wake up and see the light hit your face and your eyes looking in mine was like a dream come true. From there we started to see each other more and more. I began spending more nights at your place and you at mine. Wasn’t long before you again asked the question of ""what are we?"". Without hesitation I told her I want you to be mine. She was like a drug to me, the more of her I had the more of her I needed. It eventually hit a point where we were spending every night together. You worked late nights at the time and I worked all day so late night was all we had. One night you were supposed to come over and I had fallen asleep and missed you. I woke up an hour after you had come and gone. I texted you and explained, but I couldn’t sleep after that. From that point on I literally couldn’t manage to sleep without you. On the rare nights that I would have to I would just wake up repeatedly. 

Three months later you asks me to move in, and I do. I had never been happier in my life despite having some very difficult things happening in my life at the time. I had never clicked with anyone the way I do with my you. We seem to be on the same page with everything from politics to music to raising kids. I slowly realized you were actually my dream girl, a beautiful girl (without the makeup!), kinda a hippie type, and still that free spirit who was weird in all the best ways and always made me feel like a kid. It hit the point where we were so in sync that we were finishing each other’s sentences/thoughts word for word. It was kinda of unbelievable. We quickly became that couple that was so in love that we were making people wanna vomit, and didn’t care. When I was with her everything just felt right and it truly felt like as long as I had you, nothing else mattered.

Fast forward two more months, and I’m happier then I ever thought I could be. Even though its only been five months I already can’t imagine a life without you. I begin to joke with you about proposing to which you replies that you would say yes any time. So, I tell you ""well I have to get a ring first"". Well you then tells me that I could just use her grandmothers ring. You had shown me this ring once before randomly prior. Well this continues and I decide that I can’t wait til my finances are actually good enough to buy you a ring. I waited to sneak the ring out of your jewelry box and finally did. Down side was I wasn’t completely sure at this point if I had grabbed the right one, and obviously couldn’t ask. A day or two go by and we go out walking one night on one of our adventures and I decided that that would be the night. We walked for hours. The whole time I’m nervously trying to pick the words or exact moment. So, for hours I walked nervously with the ring in my hand. Finally, we get back to the house and I still couldn’t get the courage to ask. I try to stall going in the house and it begins raining. You start to turn to go in and I knew I had to go for it. I grabbed your hand and slipped the ring in it, got down on one knee and said ""(SmokinJester420) will you marry me?"". With tears in your eyes and the biggest smile I had ever seen you smile you said “YES!!!”. There we were, rolling on the ground in the rain kissing and smiling and feeling happier then we ever had before.

So after almost twenty years you were mine. We had gone inside and fell asleep. The next morning, we wake up and started joking about eloping as neither of us was big on the whole traditional wedding. Well joking escalated to looking in to same day marriage. We couldn’t do it in our state but if we wanted to drive a few hours to the next state we could. So then came the question of how much will it cost. Finally, we find out the grand total. At the time we were broke, so we decided for the hell of it we’ll see how much change we have in our change jar. To our amazement there is literally exactly enough to cover getting married and the gas and tolls for the trip. I still to this day can’t believe the odds of it working out so perfectly. So off we went. From one building to the next, racing the clock due to how long the trip took. I’ll never forget how exciting it was, and your face and the way your hair blew in the wind as we ran from building to building. Neither of us had any special vows or can even remember what the guy said. Tbh, all we really remember was anxiously awaiting our first kiss as a married couple. Aside from the births of my children, it was easily the greatest day of my whole life.

Here we are a year later celebrating our one-year anniversary. In the last year of being married to you I have done more living than I have in probably the past ten years. The honeymoon phase has passed and I couldn’t be happier with what I’m left with. We may not be making people wanna vomit anymore but I still couldn’t be more in love with you. I still feel lucky every time I wake up and have you in my arms. Its funny, you'll ask me if I’m still gonna love you when we’re old and you're not pretty anymore. I tell you that you'll always be pretty. To which you reply “I won’t, eventually I’ll be wrinkled and decrepit”. I always laugh and tell you that doesn’t matter because the most beautiful thing about you is who you are and the sparkle in your eyes, and that will never change...

345,An updated version of a previous post!,"Hello lovely redditor that stumbled upon this post! :) I made a post a month or two ago about this same topic, but I have finalized my love letter to the girl I love. I also want to see what people think of the way that I am going to tell her I love her.

Background: Chloe is the name of the girl I love and she is amazing. Our families have been connected since before either of us were born (14 years.) I am 14 y/o and she is 13 y/o. Every experience that I get with her, I feel the force of love   between us. She is an amazing skier, photographer, and most importantly, person. 

Here is the finalized letter:

&gt;Dear Chloe,  
&gt;  
&gt;This is really complicated, but I love you. Yes, that way.  Before you immediately decide to friendzone me, please read this letter. Remember that time that you asked me if  I liked you and I said no? Yeah, I was lying. A love letter must be rare occurrence in this connected world.  
&gt;  
&gt;It was April 2018 (Yes, that long ago) when I felt that gut feeling. I think that I told you of this gut feeling once, this desire for somebody. It is the true sensation of love, the love of one’s soul and personality. **I feel that for you.** I believe that I was in deep thought when I realized, ""Damn, I really like Chloe. Who saw that coming?""  Nevertheless, I still think you are beautiful.  
&gt;  
&gt;I agreed to be cousins because that was a reason to spend time with you. And it's not weird because of how long our families have been acquainted. I’m *literally* friends with your dad. We don't have to break rules to be together.  
&gt;  
&gt;I feel like there has to be something more between us. What about all those interactions between us. Me lending you my phone charger. Walking back from CrossFit in the snow squall of November 2018 and talking about stuff. Many times when I would leave my house 20 minutes early and we would walk to school together. Or all the times at Belleayre? You unclipped my skis once in the deep powder as a joke. That was fun. Or when you gave me a snow shower when I was waiting around the bend of Horseshoe Pass. What about that 35 minute chat we had on the phone about whatever? Or how about how much I cared about your high school application.  
&gt;  
&gt;I don’t know exactly why I love you Chloe, but I know this. My conscious self loves you because you’re beautiful, smart, funny, cool, interesting, strong, powerful, talented, conscientious, wondrous, generous, bold, exciting, and creative.  
&gt;  
&gt;I respect you, Chloe. You just seem perfect to me.  
&gt;  
&gt;A privilege to be of your consideration,  
&gt;  
&gt;*Henrikthetechie*

I have decided that I am going to tell her I love her on friday/saturday. I had a chance to tell her last sunday, but my anxiety ruined it.

Friday: I am going to text her when we are both in the car driving to the ski mountain. This is usually when she responds to my texts and when we can have texting conversation because neither of us are preoccupied with anything. During this text conversation, I am going to tell her that I like her. This will help me get past my anxiety and get the ball rolling.

Saturday evening: After skiing, our families usually go to her ski house. At this point she will likely want to talk about the whole ""I like you"" thing. So, I am going to ask her if we can go outside when it is dark out, since we are in the rural mountains, we can see stars. At that point, I am going to walk out into the field with her. There, I will hand her the letter. If she says yes, which I have concluded that  *I SURE HOPE SO,*  then I am going to try and say this: ""You know, the stars are pretty beautiful tonight. *pause for effect* You know what else is beautiful tonight? You."" 

Obviously, there is tons more background information that would be impossible to write down here. But what Do you think? Here's a link picture of me (left) and Chloe (right) for reference.

346,I think the guy I like likes my friend ... [online],"Hi guys.

So I met that guys in October on a video game. We got to know each other (he's a guy, I am too and we're bot bisexual).

recently I've invited my friend (who's a girl with us) and although that guy showed me many signs of interest he seems to get more and more interested in my friend (he wanted to play with her, he asked a picture of her face to me and where she lives).

I tried to talk about it to him and he just kinda skipped it.

I'm just feeling extremely bad right now, because although my friend is not iterested in him, it still hurts to know he might get interested in other people than me.

So I'm just looking for tips on how to get over it, accept it.

350,found the love of my life,"Maybe it's just the pre-Valentine's day sappiness, but I [F]19 can't stop thinking about how in love I am with my boyfriend [M]20. We met through tinder and hit it off instantly, talking for basically a week straight. When we finally met up, the chemistry was electric. I don't want to say ""love at first sight"", because that's cheesy, so I'm going to say ""caught feelings at first sight"". 

Things have only gotten better. It's been half a year and he's stuck by my side through a bad mental health spell, a tough semester, and quite a few rough nights. He's so absolutely wonderful, always thinking about what I need and being as kind as one can possibly be. 

He's insanely good at what he does. He's a writer that covers college sports. I don't think he knows this, but even though I don't quite care for sports, I read all of the things he writes. I've clicked on so many links that the Facebook thinks I enjoy sports. 

I get bad panic attacks during sex sometimes. He immediately comforts me, talks in a soothing voice, and holds me close. Those things may sound small, but they're the most caring actions anyone has ever done for me. 

I love him with all my heart. He makes me laugh, makes me think, and makes me cry (in the good way! I promise!). He makes me feel like I can handle whatever life throws my way.

Really just needed to scream this to the world tonight. If you've gotten this far, one- thanks for reading, and two- I hope that you find someone that makes me feel the way he makes me feel.

Not being able to go 10 seconds without kissing them, not feeling comfortable without one hand touching them at all times. I want someone to make me feel more at home than I do in the place I grew up, happier than any song or drug could ever make me feel. I want to sleep with my arms wrapped tightly around them, and notice their breath change as they eventually fall asleep. I want to be intoxicated by the smell of their clothes, their hair, their skin.

354,Long term relationship love! What is yours like?,"Hi everyone! Maybe it’s the valentines holiday coming up that making me feel gushy. But I’d love to talk about long term relationship love.
Curious to see how others interpret or experience it! 

To start-
I’ve been in a relationship consistently for four years. We are in our early 20s and not financially stable, so marriage isn’t on the table right now. Anyway, after four years I find myself still looking at my boyfriend and feeling so in love with him. It’s a strong sensation and it makes me so incredibly happy to just watch him talk. I mean if this was a cartoon there would be hearts in my eyes! 
Now, our relationship isn’t perfect and there are some days this doesn’t happen, and we’ve gone through our share of rough periods. But we always work through them and find ourselves back on track. Ans for the majority of the time my heart grows 10x bigger when I’m around him.

It’s fascinating to me that I’ve been with him for so long and I still feel like it’s our first date! You hear people talk about how when you’re together for so long you still love each other, but it changes and turns less intense but more stable.

What do you think? Do you feel the same way? Do you and your partner love differently? How have you been able to make a long term relationship work and still feel in love? Curious to know others stories or to see if someone can relate so I don’t feel like the only one lol

364,I got married a couple weeks ago.,"I just want to let my fellow hopeless-romantics out there know;
It will happen for you. If it happened for me, it will happen for you. 

You may spend some time giving up hope, trying to force it, or tricking yourself into believing something that won’t end up true.

But you will find someone, and you will instantly know, they are the one. It’s real. No questions. You will feel better than you ever have with anyone else in a way that just makes you say, “yup, this is what I want meant for this whole time.” And you will love this person so much that you will not be concerned with how much they love you, you will want to focus harder on making them happy, but this will be okay; it won’t be scary; because it will be mutual and returned and you will feel so secure. You will know that they are doing the same for you, so you don’t need to worry about how much your giving/investing, it will make you feel happy to do so, every day. It will always be mutual.
You will be appreciated and appreciate. You will feel whole. 
You will see that no amount of advice prepared you for this, most of the advice doesn’t even fit or make sense, or apply, but it never mattered, because what it is now, is perfect. All the things before are irrelevant. It’s just you and them, in your own world, your own synchronized rhythm, and it’s no one else’s truth. Just your world together. 

It will happen for you. I found my soulmate sleeping soundly in the back of a pick up truck, and we knew from that night, that this was it. Six months later we eloped, no concerns, no doubts, just love. It’s what we both always wanted. We never knew why we wanted the things we did throughout our lives, until we met, and those things aligned perfectly with each other. 

Security, respect, tenderness, romance, and an infinite amount of FUN. So much fun. This person is my best friend and my rock, my lover and my leader, and I am the same for them. someone I will support and guide without fear or limits. 

Fuck what anyone else says about what they think love should look like; yours will look the way it was meant to be for you. And nothing else will matter because your truth together will literally be the only thing that ties together your reality. It’s beautiful. 

Don’t lose faith. They are out there for you. And when you meet, it will not feel like you waited long, it will feel like they were always with you this whole time.

365,F***** Fallacy," 

So many roads lead you there but only one can lead you here. Where is here? You’re not even sure. You have no idea how you got here. You have no idea where you’re at. Looking around it’s a dazing, spinning, and making you dizzy. You’re not sure it’s making you sick but you feel flutters in your stomach. It seems as if the caterpillars have finally come from their cocoons to swarm your stomach. You know why, today is the day you’ve been waiting for. Today is the day. One more time today is the fucking day. You’ve felt the same way for and inconceivable while, holding it back. With every second expecting it to snap in your face like a surgical tubing slingshot. She finally said I love you. She’s falling. She’s falling right into the trap. Now for the next step, how can you fuck her life up… Well, start somewhere and work from there.  

Okay, You  didn't really know until you were on your own. Now that you are alone is pretty plain to see. You “love” her even though you're not quite sure what love means. You’ve said I love you a few times in your life. Knowingly lied for most. You know you always have to say it to your mother, even if you don't feel this way. Even if she doesn't make you feel anything but overwhelmingly thankful. You know you have to say it and love your family,  and they’re dear, but still. You know some of your friends love you and you hold them equal, you just don't feel this, you don't feel this love thing. You said it a couple times to throw other women off. It always works well, it’s easy to act. Even if you were a terrible liar the word itself covered up your acting flaws. It was like one of those movies that isn’t funny but people still laugh at or tell you it is because it has that special “ring” to the name. Like, Adam Sandler’s \*Insert title from any of his last dozen movies here\*. You know what I’m talking about, I mean right? Saying it, but knowing it never really truly held value. It was like the US dollar. Holding it, having it, and the reassurance made everybody feel great but it was worthless without being backed by gold or an understanding of what love actually was. Fuck, it was Starwars… Used to mean something but after the modern day overuse, remakes, and putting it everywhere it shouldn’t be, it was give or take. It was once die hard for almost everybody, not now. Now that you have her though, you're positive you know what something feels like. Is there a better word for all this one that means what ""love"" used to? There's something that keeps you up at night wishing she was there. Something that you look for in every female interaction but don’t see in anybody but her. This something is added to the girl you didn't think could be cuter. It's the something that puts her on the same level as your best friend, your dog. The animal you’d sacrifice your life for and couldn’t even hear him say thank you. Okay maybe not to the level of your dog but close, really fucking close.  Pretty sure you love your dog, so you're pretty sure you love her. Even if it makes you feel different like you've never felt before. Even if it doesn't sound like the movies, or the TV shows, or the books naked scene that can be poorly written but leaves women drooling \*cough, fifty shits of gray, cough\*. Even if it doesn't move you in the same way the only other woman you've ever loved did. You're pretty sure this is what it supposed to feel like. This is the tree you know will grow. You’re pretty sure this is okay. For always fighting different battles in relationships, it’s nice to be at peace for once. it's not only how much you touch me, It’s the way you’ve touched the rest of the people we’ve seen, my family, my friends, and most importantly that damn dog.

If  you think somebody, or that somebody out there is your better half; you'll only view yourself as half a person when that person suddenly becomes not there anymore. View yourself as self-sufficient, and you will become the best person you can be so that ""You can have a much easier time finding your True Love, and keeping your True Love once you have them.""

Comparing Love to True Love: ""What, is regular Love always false than? Is it even capable of being false?

To, I have nothing left to say
but goodbye

I wish I meant my last words

380,A Lifetime Of Lessons Through A Message In A Bottle,"If Pat Robinson could look into the past and speak with his younger self – a boy of barely 15 responding to a message in a bottle from an unknown girl named Audrey that washed upon the shores of the English countryside – he would tell that boy to look forward to a family filled with love.

All he needed to do was write back to this unknown girl.

He did just that, starting a year-long correspondence before eventually turning up upon her doorstep to meet the young lady in person. They were engaged not long after and married in 1951.  Four and a half generations have passed since Pat’s cousin found that bottle and the family he could never have imagined then, has blossomed around him. A daughter and two sons blessed them with grandchildren and great grandchildren, and today his love for Audrey is as strong as it has ever been. His family remains his greatest treasure.

He and Audrey now live together at the Village of Riverside Glen. Audrey’s needs are greater than Pat’s as age and health have warranted so they live in separate neighbourhoods, but they are together as often as possible. The team makes sure of it. Doug Wigood, the neighbourhood coordinator in the Village’s Emma’s Neighbourhood where Audrey lives, says the depth of the connection he sees in the Robinsons is as pure as anything can be.

The world seems to have grown more complicated, Pat says, since the days he was courting Audrey, proposing marriage and making their way towards a new future in Canada. Marriage then, “was a new beginning,” he says,” sharing your life and starting a family.” While that may still be the intention today, he says, it seems younger generations tend to get caught in the whirlwind pursuit of material things: “the big house, the big car, vacations,” as he puts it.

He can’t say what’s right and what’s wrong in terms of the pursuits of younger generations, he can only impart a few lessons learned over time.  

“Material things are not the most important things in life,” Pat says. “Family, love, health, friends and respect are.”

The winds of fate carried a message in a bottle to him, and he chose to answer. In doing so he set a course that led him and his love to a beautiful life together filled with those most important things in life. The team members who’ve come to know Pat and Audrey find inspiration in this simplicity. Upon this Valentine’s Day, they wish to shine a light upon it, and share their gratitude with an inspiring couple.

397,I lost the love of my life...,"I never thought I’d type anything in here but this feeling hurts... Me (M19) and my ex (W19) we’re together for a Year and a month, and we were madly in love. I gave her my heart, and she knew everything about me. Every flaw I had, she accepted and she thought I was perfect. What can I say? I was the luckiest guy in the whole world. We were a young couple but we knew what we wanted. I was always afraid of losing her but we stumbled upon a post. The post talked about how love was a choice, and the feeling of love will start to fade, it is the choice whether to keep trying or to give up. After we read that, she gave me a card that wrote “There will come a time where our feelings will drift apart and the “feeling of love” of will start to fade. That is when love becomes a choice, and when that time comes my choice will be you, always” and that put a tear in my eye knowing I’d be with this girl forever. After awhile things did start to change. I became too dependent on happiness from her and I became clingy because I loved her so much.  But that made me disregard school and work. As time passed she started to get stressed from school and I just added on even more stress cause like I said i was dependent on her for happiness. The date is 2/11/19, and she’s had enough and decided to break up with me. A couple days have passed and I’m still madly in love with her but she doesn’t wanna talk to me. I’m devastated and I wish I could go back in time and change things so we wouldn’t be in this situation. I will always love this girl, no matter how distance we become I will always be there to love and support her. I hope in the future we can become friends or who knows maybe even get back together.

399,Anyone else think there shouldn't be Valentine's day?,"Don't get me wrong, I like the initial idea. Yes, love should have its special day and all the couples should celebrate it. But even though I'm in a perfect relationship, I still get a bad feeling in my stomach whenever this day is coming. And I don't think I'm the only one.





Firstly, love shouldn't be a social thing. It's something too intimate and personal to be that. I'd never want my relationship to be ""one of the many"". The real Valentine's day should be the day the relationship was made.






I also see this holiday as more of a competition nowadays. Especially in schools. As much as you try to ignore it, you subconsciously compare to other couples. This, combined with your SO's expectations make your ""special gift"" just a gift. A chore. Something that would just show that your relationship is special too. This takes the heart out of the gesture. And when it comes to love, that's a crime.



A couple shouldn't feel pressured to make special things for their SO. These things come naturally out of the heart. I've surprised my girl so much better on random days, just because I felt like it! She too. And that's how it should be. Try celebrating your love everyday like us. I know it's cliché as fuck, but it is because it's true.




Maybe instead of this holiday, we should've had something just for the singles. Like Valentine's, but without the couples' part.",love,1550194641,Ivaylo_87,3,1,True,2019-02-14

&amp;#x200B;

In regards to the summer of 2016, simply recollecting that ""I fell for you"" would be a major understatement. I was taken by you. I was enamored.. I was captured by that stunning face of yours and that big smile never failed to catch my eyes. I was craving to be in your presence--giddy like a child because nothing else made me feel more alive than you. I still love you, B. I'm fascinated with your devotion and intent to understand all of the inner workings. The capacity and patience you have to love and forgive someone for their errors. this past year has been strewn with misunderstandings and mistakes, while you remained steady with your unwavering commitment to us. Now, when you say you love me, i believe it. 

NOW When I say 'I' love you, i want you to believe it

To: My friend. My Lover

To The woman i have yet to hold physically close to me, but never ceases to appear in dreams and is found occupied in every river or deep valley of my thoughts. 

I believe there was a a period (i cant recall the exact) over the last 4 or 5 months where we began to lose eachother. Filled with usual pity I eloped with the fear of losing you. My own ego continued to inflate until it captured me. You have been nothing but an amazing friend and a muse to me B. Maybe all of our struggle will happen to be the most crucial essential chapter in our story. 

Recently you had an observation you brought up about my own obsession with certainty. It's FINALLY opened my eyes: does nothing but weaken our armor. You said to take the risk because some of the most beautiful discoveries are found in the mystery and uncertainties of life. You referenced a quote from a classic french children's book (i still yet to find a copy of) ""the little prince"" that had quite an effect on me. i printed it out the illustration and put it inside this locket to remember.. ""It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important"" Lets use this patience to our advantage, and lets embrace it. We've been on this journey for so long that i'm CERTAIN it'll all be worth it to wake up next to each other one day. i love you Isabelle. I miss you. Happy Valentines Day gorgeous.

I had somebody deliver it to her and while I was on the phone with her all she could do was laugh out of excitement.

409,The love of my life.,"This Valentine’s Day has been rough. Seeing happy couples everywhere makes me miss her even more. People say I need to move on but I feel that I can’t. I was so happy with her, even when we had our bad days. I opened up to her when I couldn’t do it for anyone else. Seeing her and not being able to touch her like I used to or kiss her like I used to makes it hurt even more. I am still in love with her. I have done things that I regret but she is the one of the few choices that I have made in this life that I will never regret. She is so strong willed, gentle, beautiful, compassionate, loving, and understanding. I feel that I won’t be able to find that in a woman. I regretfully made a mistake on Saturday and went to dinner with another woman trying to get over her, but doing that I feel that I have made things worse. I feel so guilty for what I did and I know I hurt her when she found out. That was the dumbest thing I did and for that I know I more than likely ruined any chance I had left. I know she is in a bad place right now and I wish and prey that she didn’t push me away. I want to be her rock like she was mine. I want to be her reason to love like she was mine. I want to be her reason to be a better person like she was mine. She says that there could be a chance to be together again and half of me wants it to be true and the other half of me feels it won’t happen and that hurts. I have never felt this strongly for a woman and it frustrates me that I can’t show or tell her how I feel! I hope she gets better soon because I want her back in my arms. I miss her so much and I don’t think she knows how much I’m hurting inside. She was the first woman I believed I was going to have a future with. I prey that I will still have the future I dreamed of with her.

410,My favorite person,"I can gush about you for hours and hours and still have more to say. There’s never been a day in all the years i’ve known you that I doubted you or how I felt about you. You are the best thing to ever happen to me and it blows my mind that I can possibly feel this much let alone feel this much about someone. But you’re not just someone, you’re you. There’s no one better than you. 

You have no idea how much your smarts and the way your mind works is spectacular. You are the most intelligent person I have ever met.

Every time I see you, my heart kinda flutters and my cheeks hurt because my smile is so wide.  Your hugs make me melt and make me feel as though everything else disappears. You know how to make me smile and laugh even when i’m far from the mood. 

You’ll come across stuff that’s overwhelming and stressful, stuff that make you wanna rip your hair out, but i’m always only a call away. I’m always by your side just as you are by mine. You are strong and get through anything life throws at you. You can do anything.

You are genuine and kind. You are adorable and sweet. You do so many little things that make my soul fly. You make me feel special and you know how to make little things like getting noodles exciting. Hot chocolate is forever connected to those few chilly nights we got to spend together.

Sleeping to your voice and laugh is the best thing to end the day with. You are every sweet dream put into a real life person. You are perfect and you are one of a kind. There’s no one that could even possibly compare to you and the warmth of your energy. 

You always make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside and when I look at you, i’m home. I am so thankful to know you. I’m so lucky to have you in my life because you know me better than anyone and tell me what I should hear. 

Thank you for every smile, every wish, every sweet talk, and everything in general. Thank you for always bringing out the best in me. Thank you for the countless times you’ve made my day. 

I will never grow tired of loving you because you are so easy to love, so adorable, and have the most gorgeous galaxies of eyes and leaving me starry-eyed.

And at nights you had your ways

Inevitable was the fall

We weren't being ourselves anyway

From, I have no words at all

To, I have nothing left to say
but goodbye


I wish I meant my last words

So strong was my will

I'm currently in love with girl who's a devout Christian and I'm a nonbeliever. I've fully disclosed myself in regards to my beliefs and political ideologies and she seems to accept for who I am, in terms of being friends. There have been moments where we've admitted having feelings for each other, but we've never taken our relationship to an intimate level. I've never tried to, cause I understand that's her decision make. At first she was in denial about her feelings towards me and would tell me that she could only be with someone who shares her beliefs, so I respected that and continued being her friend and supported her anyway I could. It's was only just recently that she admitted having feelings for me, but explained that she's currently not looking for a relationship and that it would have to be miracle from God, if she were to be in a relationship at this moment in time.

The way that I see it, is that she can't be with a sinner, cause in her eyes, that's what I am. And now all that I can do is live with acceptance.

Recently ive been writting letters to him but not sending them. (Its a technique used in therapy).  I have written 20 pages worth of letters to try to tell him im sorry and love him and to try to explain how i saw things. 

But Each time ive finished a letter, i dont feel better at all. And i have the strong urge to drive to his house and stick all of the letters into his mail slot.

439,I really need a good advice,"Does she like me? Cuz she is kinda my biggest crush

So the last 3 days at school me and her stayed in the same desk and how did that start? Both mine and her desk colleague were missing and I kinda wanted to stay with her to understand her more better,well, I saw one of our classmate go to her ,sit down,put her things down and then they talked a bit. After a few seconds I see that classmate leave with her whole things and then I went to my crush and said that mine and her deskmate weren't present that day. She instantly asked me if I want to sit with her. I felt so special...

In those 3 days(our desk mates weren't present for 3 days in a row) we talked a lot and she initiated a lot of conversations, touched me a lot,told me all kind of personal things,I keep catching her looking at me , she makes her hair and there was this one time she told me to look at her when she made her hair,she laughs at every goddamn joke of micne and so on...

BUT there was this one time. She drew me and then she said ""I'm going to draw your girlfriend""(she was drawing me in the future) and after a bit she asked me if I like somebody from my class and I said""you!"" ,after that she jokingly(I think) said"" that's not the correct answer,I'm afraid"".

What do you guys think? Should I ask her out this Sunday because imma get Drunk today and it's gonna and easier to ask her that.

Btw why do I think so hard that she likes me is that she always always smiles so dn hard and so damn natural and me too. It's kinda like a spell put on both of us.",love,1550295429,Rolyray,2,2,True,2019-02-16
440,Today marked 1 year as a couple! (LDR),"Although he [25M] and I [22F] are in a long distance relationship, we managed to make the best out of our 1 Year anniversary! It was perfect in it’s own special way!!

It was his first relationship to last this long! And for me it was the first man I genuinely and confidently can say I love. He has made me the happiest girl and brought the best of me throughout the entire year. He helped me overcome many inner conflict and always chose to love me even when I didn’t deserve it. I accept and cherish all that he is. And I love him unconditionally.

I will say though we did start off rough the night prior to our 1 year. We had a misunderstanding and argument. Some feelings were hurt and some words we didnt mean were spoken. However, that didn’t stop us to coming to a conclusion and overcoming our struggle. We came out stronger and more secure and technically our 1 Year Day started.

 We spoke to each other’s love languages (his words of affirmation and my receiving gifts; both our second love language is quality time). I bought him Adidas sneakers and funny boxers with our faces on it and mailed him my old sketchbook full of the time I had a crush on him. But the most precious thing I did for him was to read my unsent love letters out loud to him and then tell him vulnerable deep romantic feelings I had about him. He gave me words of comfort and affirmation and affection, then had bought me red tulips (my fav flower) and a Boyfriend Body Pillow. We laughed so much about how funny it looked but it was super sweet why he bought it. He always wished to give me physical affection and saw how much I sacrificed that need in our LDR. And he talked about how excited he is for me to graduate so we can get married and live with each other. He made me cry out of love. I never felt so loved by anyone else but him.

It was a day full of wholesomeness, honesty, love, passion, laughs, improvement, hopes, proudness, and thanks. I love this man so much and I always look at the promise ring he gave me. He is my one and only and I can’t wait to spend the rest of eternity with him.",love,1550295536,digitalren,2,28,True,2019-02-16
441,Best friend,"So, here is the skinny. I have been friends with this girl for roughly  5 maybe 6 years. And I would say about 3 years ago we became best friends. We have went on vacations together  As well as having gone on very many little day trips together.

 For many years I have not found her attractive. And even though I still don't find her that attractive I think over the years of being friends I have fallen in love with her. Now the problem is as always with a  These situations I don't know if I should risk our friendship by telling her or  Just try and let it die.

I am pretty sure we both feel the same way. Neither one of us find see other extremely attractive or maybe even moderately attractive. The  Problem is even though I don't find  Her that attractive I can see myself spending the rest of my life with her. We have all the same interest we are very similar but neither one of us seems to have that physical attraction to each other.

  I have dated a very close friend and the past and after it didn't work out we are no longer friends. And I would rather stay friends with this person then risk  Losing that friendship.

I came to know about her by her little sister . .which also was kind of a Best friend to me and my Firstlove 
I kept by myself all the feelings I had...life was Just passing by...untill I saw her...
I never felt that right before....
I knew it was her as she looks Soo like her sister...

I texted her for the first time on October 2 2016...
She replied...
We Chatted ...
And for the first few months our chats would be uncompleted and short....

It was during my boards I came to know I needed her that bad...
I had to look at her pictures ever night....or else I couldn't be able to sleep...
I remembered there was a small D camera where I kept her photos....
I would look at her smile ....
Her eyes ...(She has the most beautiful eyes)...

Time went Soo quickly after my exams...
She started spending more time chatting...with me...
I was Soo happy ...she began to tell me her darkest secrets and moreover her feelings....

We never met tho...

She Went to a different state for her studies...
And I went to a different state ...
We just have our phones...by which we share everything....

Her Sister passed away On the November of past year...
I could do nothing for her and neither could i say anything to her as even I went Numb by the fact that I couldn't meet her again ....

Now she's back to her institution...and she's recovering slowly....
She's strong...
She really is....
I don't know how but she's... working fine these days..or she just pretend..to be...
I was dead worried for her and her future....
Until she said...
'I will do my best for the ones who loves me and the ones I love'

447,BF and I both said (wrote?) “I love you” for the first time :),"I (F19) have been dating my boyfriend (M23) for about six months now. I’ll try to keep this all brief. 

I’ve been wanting to tell him I love him since about December or so, and I wrote a couple letters telling him but never gave them to him. (Our colleges are about 3 hours away, so we do this thing where I’ll sometimes write him sweet letters to take with him and read up there.) And I have been asking him to try to write me a little love letter since the beginning of our relationship. 

Fast forward to Thursday, Valentine’s Day. We’re both in school, but we make plans for the weekend &amp; to see each other Friday. So I decide to write him a Valentines letter. But by the end, I basically say f*** it, and write in the final line that I love him, but know he isn’t ready so we’ll keep it a secret. 

Then on Friday, I see him. And in the passenger’s side when I get in his car are roses, chocolates, and a notebook. Later when I open the notebook, there’s two pages he’s written (I read it when he steps out of the room later— he didn’t want me to read it while he was there). It’s a super sweet letter. And on the last page he starts listing things he loves about me. (“I love your hair. I love your smile.”, etc) 
And the very last line is “I love you.” 

I just think it’s so funny that we both did that finally, each on the same day, but it was in letters because we were both afraid. :) I’m just so happy. it was a really really good valentines. ",love,1550330904,Professormoony7,1,20,True,2019-02-16

452,Having a feeling you won't find me,"I'm beginning to believe that you drive up into the neighborhood I reside in with her to provoke jealousy on my behalf and you seem to keep doing it with multiple women: driving with her in the passenger seat, showing me how successful you are at getting laid...since you know that I left. What you don't understand is that I didn't leave you. You were taken! You told me she was hot too! You told the whole room ""you have one and she is HOT!"" What are you doing around here then, with women other than your wife? 

What are you doing? If you hadn't been married I would have stayed. So you silently expected me to wait for you while you sorted out your outward rationale as to how the woman you were with five or six years ago was more attractive than me? Only to leave the woman you were with after I had left that office, to date your coworker with whom you drove up into my neighborhood just to check up on me while making me jealous at the same time? Let me tell you something. You are wasting your time. If you think I'm an easy lay, then why are you putting on an act and hurting me in so many different ways? You are incapable of getting out of your car and saying hello (i cant see if its you or not, im not the one who does  the chase and I don't have car nor night vision...nor good vision! )though you find it necessary to ""punish"" me knowing that ultimately you'll get to eat your cake in the end? Why do I let you do this to me? Why do I let you do this to your children, your ex-wife who has had to deal with your incontrollable caregiver-superior behavior since the moment you convinced her her petite butt was going to be licked in skyscraper peaks until the end of your days together?

Yet with me it was different? With me you realized I was the one you'd been waiting for your entire life and as soon as I knew you might misinterpret my leaving to give you a chance to do something about it, you'd ball-and-chain me to your power over every other woman you manage to convince yourself is more worth your time.

I'm tired of it and my doubt that you'll ever understand my hope that you'll ever hear my cries will only keep you from bingeing on different women will ever make sense. I have been attacked and I feel as though you paid money for it to occur. But you didn't pay him enough, did you? 

I am done with this evil and it hurts that there is nowhere to go. You are only going to defend my words with your lawful self-righteousness as to what the logical things to do or say are. 

It hurts to know that I have no power. You can choose to kill me if you want but you know you can't. Though there is no running away from you and you held a lit one to let me know that you're the one who isn't speaking. And then the woman. The one who showed me around! The one who gives enough about you to know that you both hold traditional views on the subject of evolution and ritual religiousness in it's own right! You continue to leave me barren as a peasant and even kicked out of a world in which my parents worked hard for me to feel free in.

And you know you do this to me. And I hate it. I can't find the words to say that I wish I never met you because I was the one with the power in that elevator and you overthrew my confidence in that arena with a polite, formal, ""well now you do, so feel tough-minded, cat!"" 

Though you were MARRIED. You wear your wedding ring! Why did you ever have to talk to me in the first place? If you couldn't even properly rationalize the fact that you have the control of your environment and with each hold of a coin you are the lying evil. You could build your own house made of sugar but you choose not to. Because you will have to spend years before gaining the courage to come up to me outside, informally, in broad daylight, as a real man, to let me know that we don't have to live here anymore.

455,Dear Oliver,"      I miss you. 
I remember when we met in our last year of elementary school. I was really quiet and you were a loud, always getting into trouble. You helped me come out of my shell. We would walk together after school with my sister and a couple of friends. To me you were always annoying and “mean” and I didn’t want to be friends with you but you were always there......
    Every time I tried to push you away, you always got closer. Even though you made fun of me at times, you somehow helped me. To the little things of saying “it’s okay to laugh” and “your strong for a girl”. 
       We would insult each other in a joking way and through that you saw me for me. You didn’t see a shy quiet girl, you saw ME. Sometimes in class you would tell everyone how much of a “diva” I was but they never believed you. 
       I remember the day you told us you were moving. I didn’t really care because I didn’t see it as much and there was still time left.
    On the last day of school we all walked home for the last time. You see...I didn’t realize that would be the last time I would see you or talk to you. I didn’t even get to say Goodbye. 
      Sometimes I would see you at church but not anymore. 
   Years have past and I still remember you and feel like it was only yesterday. I think you about you everyday and how you are doing.I sometimes wonder if you still even remember me. I sometimes wonder why I care so much. Maybe because without you I wouldn’t be who I am today. You taught me not to afraid and how to find my voice. 
   We met in elementary and now we are in high school. But I still have hope that somehow we’ll meet again. Thansk for being a part of my life",love,1550356702,Etecia23,1,5,True,2019-02-16

458,I told my boyfriend that I love him for the first time in a Valentine’s Day card that I had him read in front of me.,"For Valentine’s Day, I wrote a long note in my boyfriend’s card, which was one of those generic cards without any writing on the inside. For context, we’ve been “officially” dating since March but started casually seeing each other a couple of months before then. I’ve been wanting to tell him that I love him for months but I always stopped myself because I felt the moment wasn’t right, although I knew that was a bit foolish. 

Here’s my note to him:

“When I think about my feelings for you, I often think about our first few conversations. Despite being strangers, I felt intrinsically close to you—as if I’ve known you for a long time, like you were an old friend. That deep-rooted connection of ours has held us close through the transformations of our relationship—through emotional and physical boundaries and distances alike.

My feelings have grown for you when I discovered your yearn to know and understand me, coupled with your patience of allowing me to open up to you at my own pace. Both my feelings and I have grown as I reach personal milestones with authenticating myself to you.

I feel my heart warm when you speak of your desires and dreams, of what makes your heart and mind wander. Your evoked dreams of the future makes me want to be more daring and actively curious of my own pursuits of the heart and mind. It also leaves me to hope that our pursuits, while willfully independent of one another, can also be entwines together—like vines that grow separate of one another, but are so interwoven together that it becomes hard to imagine them apart.

I hope to be given endlessly more ways to describe how I feel about you. All that I know is that each description, each phrase, each metaphor and simile can collapse together as a string of words that I believe perfectly describes my feelings for you—

—I love you.”

I had him read it in front of me, and the moment he looked up at me, obviously a bit emotional from the card, I finally said “I love you” out loud to him. He pulled me in for a kiss and said “I love you, too.” After a few minutes of embracing, he then said, “I’ve known for a long time that I’ve loved you. If I had to think of everything I’ve wanted in a girl, it‘s everything that you are. I didn’t expect to be able to find you. I’m in love with you.” My heart is still on cloud nine.

This little but important milestone of ours has made us feel even closer, like we’ve finally entered a new and more serious part of our relationship. I’m so in love and so happy. I hope that everyone is able to find the type of love that they need in life.

I think I’m like “in love with love” or something. I’m a pretty lonely person and sometimes I think a lot about how it would be kinda nice to have someone to fall asleep watching Netflix with on a Friday night. Someone who I could surprise with breakfast in bed with on a Saturday morning and watch them smile a lot and shit. Just someone in general to spend time with and talk about my day.

460,Don’t stop out of fear,"Too often in movies, in books and in conversations with friends we hear the idea that love comes from hard work and persistence. That “they stuck around” or “broke down your walls” and as such you love them because they broke down your walls, walls you built to protect yourself from rejection. But there is a different kind of falling in love. The kind that although you’ve built these barriers within yourself to protect yourself from pain that you know only too well, you meet someone who makes you want to tear down your own defences from the inside out and run out to them unprotected, knowing that things could go wrong and you could get your heart broken again. But any amount of time being with them is worth going back to that dark place, because they are just that unbelievably special they don’t seem real. Take my advice. Don’t stop out of fear of hurt,  take the risk and be so happy you can’t physically express it. If you’re lucky enough to meet someone who makes you feel similar to this, don’t waste time protecting yourself and overthinking, just run to them. ",love,1550375589,black-trees,0,14,True,2019-02-16

That sounds normal in general for anyone with ADHD...but it gets worse whenever I get into a relationship. I lose focus of what I’m doing in the present moment and my mind is constantly traveling away from itself to that person.
I lose track of time more easily and have a hard time managing my emotions throughout the day.

When I’m single and not talking to anyone, it’s much easier for me to remain focused.

477,The feeling of being loved,"I just found out, maybe I forget the feeling of being loved slowly, day by day. I become so emotional and insecure when someone does sth for me, or shows me that they care about me; it's also weird, when being so well treated reminds me to the sadness, to being unwanted. Of course I still want to love and be loved, but sometimes I just have the feeling, that I have no ability to do it. All what I can do is hiding my chaos of happiness, sadness, keep watching other happy couples and craving for sth I can not have. Like I'm stucking in the middle of nowhere.

Thinking about it now makes me tear up again, especially knowing that I’ll have to leave you at least one more time before more details are known.

Our airport goodbye was one of the most sorrowing moments in my life, but it also was of the utmost intimacy. I had never cried like that for another person and here we were, you and me sharing our final moments. I thought about every adventure we had shared and all of the tears you had dried for me.

482,To anyone who’s ever met Love.,"The first time I met love he was drunk. I’m not sure if he’d ever met Love but I knew I did. Love came with heartache but Love had taught me so many things. Love was forgetful. Love didn’t always communicate. Love held me at night when I couldn’t sleep. Love bought my favorite food when I had a bad day. Love hurt me the most cause love knew how to. Love knew my worst fears and my darkest secrets but love didn’t care and love would wipe away my tears when I just could hold them back. Love would carry me home from the bar when I was drunk and take off my heels and wipe the make up off my face before tucking me into bed and kissing me on the forehead. Love knew how to make me laugh. I would listen to Loves heartbeat cause it was my favorite song. Love was selfish and made mistakes. Love knew how to break me down till I was nothing but a pool of my own emotions, that the wall I built so high up had been torn down and left with nothing but dust and rubble. Love was insecure, love didn’t love himself therefore love didn’t know how to love me. Love and I would separate and reunite, but when we reunited it was a million fire works in a 5x5 room that exploded into repressed emotions that’s been held back for so long of love happiness and resentment. What Love didn’t know was that even fireworks die out. I often find myself thinking when is the next time I will see Love. Will it be one night when you’re drunken words stumble upon mine and I believe everything you say even though I know your words are coated in whiskey . Or will I see Love when it’s too late and you’ve met a new Love and created a life with a house in suburbs with 2 sons and a daughter with a dog named Corona. Even then will Love still feel the sink in my heart that Love was the one that got away. Will Love look at me and realize the same. Will Loves life flash before his eyes and think back to 15 years ago when we laid awake till 4 am talking about if we ever had a family we’d name OUR dog Corona? What if Love finds a new Love. They say if it’s meant to be... it will be. But what if it’s not. That’s why I hold onto the memories of Love for dear life, cause everything Love has made me feel is something that is engraved into my eternal soul cause sometimes that one Love is only once in a lifetime.

Being away for these last two months and not having the chance to become a couple has been rough, but I’m coming home next week and I’ll do anything I can to make her mine. We’ll share our laughs, we’ll sit and talk, and I’ll love every second of it because I love her.

491,Love is not a feeling...,"## Hello r/love - There's a great deal to say about love, and many misunderstandings about what love is...and what it isn't. Understanding its nature, like so many things about us, can't be shared as advice, and there are no ""secrets"" to it. But it can be understood personally through the stories of how it manifests - what is love in the context of how it works in the lives of others? Story has always been how humans have shared meaning and purpose, and telling those love stories, including but moving beyond the romance, is our life's journey. We don't do advice, but we do hope - and everyone deserves a little of that.

Some people think they are lonely in the world, but I think about them everyday. They just don't know it yet... YET. 

The most popular can be the most lonely. Their lives can be much different from what we see at first glance. We don't know what goes on behind closed doors, but if we crack them open, the light can shine through.

We need to stand up to loneliness. It is the most painful part of life for some people, so let them know that there is someone there to erase those scars. Spread the word. It doesn't have to be this way. Stand up to loneliness. Thank you. ❤️",love,1550512861,SquishedBean,0,1,True,2019-02-18

You get me. 2018 was quite the year for us with a lot of ups and downs but here we are stronger than ever. I'm writing this hoping that when I'm gone you find this. Today is Monday Feb. 18th. I just got back from the doctors. What I feared most in life was not being able to spend my life with you and sadly this has become reality. All the things we planned, kids, adventures, growing together.. is no longer a possibility. I'm trying to stay strong and be a man about my situation but coming to terms with everything and realizing and understanding that there's only so much I can do is killing me. Going to the doctors alone and having them ask me why I would be alone in such a severe scenario.. it hurts not having you around  especially lately. Anyways down to the point. You've always been amazing to me, treated me well, my gift from heaven above, the light of my life. Thank you for always being you and not switching up on me, although we've had some rough times I just want you to know there's no one else I'd rather go through shit with than you. I'm a basket of problems, this I know. But trust me when I say this dear, I love you. All the little things about you. Everything. Forever in my heart and on my mind. Months from now when I'm no longer around just know I'm always watching over you. And remember to do what makes you happy, live for you.

495,i only see it because they told me to wake up and smell the roses,"I get it, age gaps in relationships are always an iffy topic, especially if it involves someone below 18 and someone who’s not. This age gap is 3 ish years (give or take), and it all started as a friendship and that’s what it still is? or i think?

i was lonely, and an “angsty teen” who didn’t know what was going on, let’s start with that. I was very depressed and going through a number of things.
i knew a family friend who we only saw maybe twice a year, his name was, well, let’s call him “Atticus” (him and i both love classic literature).
Atticus was from Montana, a couple states away from me, hence why we rarely saw him.
i knew Atticus was going through things similar to me so i started texting him every once in a while, which turned into daily. 
My family around me started to notice and they were like oh my gosh he definitely likes you. this has been going on for about a year and a half, there sometimes are periods of time where we don’t talk much but we always say we can’t see each other again. I don’t know if he truly likes me or i’m just seeing things that really don’t mean anything but i’m just seeing them because others tell me to.

You fall so deep that there’s no way you’d ever fall for anyone else again. Not like this. That’s “The One”.  You may not grow old together. You may not take the usual path couples take.

9,A,"At this point I am 14/in 8th grade, and have been in true love with a girl for almost a year. She is 13 and her name is Chloe. Our families have been friends for 15 years. Our sisters are inseparable friends.

The reason that I am writing about this is because I feel the need to let it out and get some hints. The internet is a great place huh? Basically I have been friends with this girl for my entire life, and we hang out very casually from time to time. Since very recently, I have felt something towards her which I have decided to be love. I have decided to write her a love letter. Here is some context for the letter. First, I have censored some personal details, the changed versions of which are changed and italicized. 

Some of my thought process: ""I will not mention a life together, as not to overwhelm her."" ""*my friend* doesn't need to be mentioned, he is an unnecessary detail.""

Here is the letter.

&gt;Dear Chloe,  
&gt;  
&gt;This is really complicated, but I love you. Yes, that way.  Before you immediately decide to friendzone me, please read this letter. A love letter is a rare occurrence in this connected world, where closest thing could be a 2 am text that says “U up?” Some of the greatest artists and creators through history proposed love through a letter.   
&gt;  
&gt;I was halfway through 7th grade (Yes, that long ago.) when I felt that gut feeling. I think that I told you of this gut feeling once, this desire for somebody. It is the true sensation of love, the love of one’s soul and personality. **I feel that for you.** I would not describe it as a crush, or anything similar because I think that word is to damn cheesy. It’s more than that. I would describe it as a desire. This desire for you is one of the few, simple things that keeps me happy and driven.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you think about it, it can make sense. Our parents wouldn’t resent it because they all know our mannerisms. *her sister* and *my sister* might think that it is weird, but that is simply them. We are not blood related either, so that doesn’t conflict.  
&gt;  
&gt;Remember all those times that I have done something with you or that we have hung out? All those times that I walked you home, or left my house 20 minutes early just to walk to school with you. Those times that I let you hang out in my room because our sisters were being annoying. That time that Superchief opened late and so I hiked up with you to go to the gondola. It was then too that you confided in me the reason that you were grumpy, and it was because you *woke up too late*. Yes, I remember that.  
&gt;  
&gt;When I see you or get to hang out with you, I simply enjoy the experience. I like to hang out with you. When I see you I don’t think about dirty things, or get blinded by love. I just want to be able to be closer to you, and confide in you and be intimate in a way.  
&gt;  
&gt;I respect you, Chloe. You just seem perfect to me.  
&gt;  
&gt;A privilege to be of your consideration,  
&gt;  
&gt;Henrik *the techie*

12,When are you allowed to say you love someone?,"I'm currently in a complicated situation where I've fallen for the sweetest Christian girl on the planet. Problem is, I'm a nonbeliever. I understand that love is an unknown, ever-changing feeling, and possibly gets more complicated as we age, but at this point in time, without a doubt, I feel the unexplainable feeling of love for her. I daydream about tending to her needs and I would surrender myself completely, just because of the person she is.

16,"Hi guys, I didn’t know where else to ask this question but I really need the help.","I feel immensely guilty, as a guy, for being attracted to women. I feel like the pain of being objectified is stronger than anything I’ve ever felt, and it’s something I panic about any time I even talk to a female classmate of mine. I feel so fucking disgusting whenever I masturbate, but I do it because ejaculating is one of the only things that makes me feel happy anymore. I fear no one will ever like me because I hate the idea of having children... of not only putting a woman in labor pains but also in putting another child on such a cruel world and inevitably fucking up parts of his/her life. It feels like such a selfish thing to do. I don’t know what to do guys... I’m really just insanely unhappy with the idea that our lives seem to run on sex, I feel isolated because I don’t want to have sex but rather just stick with having a close relationship and cuddling and kissing and shit, caring about each other idk. I... I don’t know what to do because I feel like I’m feeling so guilty about something no one else even seems to care about. What do I even do? How do I even develop a relationship when I don’t even know if the other person only wants sex or not... I feel like people see me as disabled or something. Am I just man-guilting myself too much or trying to justify asexual/antinatal morals? Do most women care or not if I want to have sex with them...? I feel like if I even look at a girl and appreciate her beauty I’m being objectifying and I can’t help it because my stupid brain just thinks like that. It’s like the way a woman is built or dresses up or whatever seems like art to me, but I hate the idea of that because they’re people and I want to care about them like people. I think it’s good to be aware and try to limit myself from objectifying women but I just live in constant fear that it’s gonna make me lonely and useless.

24,Chuck it love bucket.,"	Worst case scenario, you go home in the morning. That’s what she said to me if it didn’t pan out. I agreed with her, yet i sit here with this empty feeling in my stomach. I thought she was everything I’ve sought, guess not. She told me to be completely honest with my thoughts but i have yet to hear hers as she leaves me on ignore.  

	So as i sit here at this bar a shot and half in, i try to make sense of it. Feeling this empty low as i watch and listen to these people enjoy themselves. I was just told told that i am completely adorable, but in my mind it tells me i am not worthy of her love. Maybe I’m not what she was looking for, even though she tells me i am everything. 

	Love can be so deceiving. I wish i knew what she was thinking. I wish she would show me her thoughts. To be able to have that closure would make me feel relief, yet i sit here not knowing, in the dark, blind to the fact with a hole in my chest. A part of me already knows that it wont go any further for right now, if ever. I assume she’s weighing her options and deciding what she actually wants in her life right now, deciding if I’m worth the effort. I would not blame her if she didn’t choose me, i have my faults in which i have already expressed to her to early. I have already expressed a great amount of trust issues and a dissociative personality which definitely pushed her away, and since i haven’t had a text back i assume that it was a lot. But to be honest if i know myself and not this wall, i feel it would be better if I didn’t associate with her. Then again I don’t know if I’m saying this because i truly feel i would be better off without her in my life, or if its the defense mechanism wall that  i throw up when i feel hurt amongst other things. 

	She scares me because she reminds me a lot of Danielle. Danielle was a narcissistic alcoholic with a drug problem. She would always express how great she was and how she was the perfect person. Macy has shown me some narcissism and I’m not too sure about her alcohol use, but i do know about her drug problem. Doing whip its and pills, along with other things such as acid and mushrooms.  I however, do not despise the acid or mushrooms, but with the alcohol and pill use with the whip its does tell me quite a bit. I am most positive that i should not put myself with someone who does all of these substances. The lack of judgement and instability these drugs bring will only bring me heartache in the end and I’m sure after awhile it’ll make her feel like I’m holding her back from what drugs she wants to do. All of these factors are prominent in what decision i should make with this girl. If she does end up texting me back ill tell her that its not going to workout, with the added explanation of why. 

	I swear to god I’m just going to start fucking the girls i meet on tinder, because this is the third one I haven’t fucked on the first date and they never work out. I guess that’s what i get for trying to do right. Since my mind and soul aren’t ready for a relationship ill have to give them something else to come back to. I really just want to fuck, why am i chasing love so hard to the point disappointment. Trying to control the uncontrollable, what a joke.",love,1546602160,_Ghouled,0,1,True,2019-01-04

39,No one cares but...,"I once had a lot of sparks with a girl 
I didn't love her or anything, it just felt right to go after her
I gotta say I liked her tho, our conversations were interesting, we were horsing around quite often and there was a lot of physical connection as well  
Everyone noticed the chemistry, so I thought I had her
Asked her out, after panicking for a while even though she answered kinda quickly 
""Yeah let's meet at 4 pm on tuesday""
Got super excited as I was finally making progress. 
for once I thought I would have my silly love story

5 minutes before the date I was almost prepared to get going and I felt my cellphone vibrate 
I just knew it, I didn't need to read the actual message to understand the situation
What went wrong? I could have sworn I did everything right.
I read the message that delivered the sad news

Says she was sorry but she wasn't going, and the thing is I instantly now it's bs 
She just didn't want to go and she waited for the last minute to tell me

I thought maybe I was overreacting and she actually couldn't go. But after a few dull convos I noticed that she didn't want to talk to me

And in the blink of an eye she wasn't in my life anymore
Few weeks passed by and I know she is going to a party I was also going

""This is going to be fun""

And at first I didn't even look at her. Why would I? But then I could tell she stared at me from time to time.
Normally when people look at you so often you think is because they are atractted to you, but I could tell this wasn't the case
Maybe she was just remembering ""this guy, that's how he was"" 

Eventually we talked, as if nothing ever happened and that really drove me insane

Did it mean so little to you that you don't even mention what happened? I really thought I would get an explanation, maybe because I wanted one and not because I actually believed she was going to care and say the truth  

Never liked the girl so much, why do you care?
Maybe because I didn't get closure,or because out of nowhere everything fell 

At the end none of that matters because let's be honest 
I ain't getting closure and I ain't knowing why she run away 
I'll just have to get used to it

Endlessly. Never ending. Non circumstantially. Wholly. Purely. And you are one lucky person if you are loved by him. He’s introverted. Keeps to himself. Tries to go unnoticed but all I can notice in a room full of people is him. Something about him catches me and won’t let me go. His steadiness. Calmness. Quiet but fierce determination. Protectiveness over those that he loves. His unbelievable strength in the midst of unimaginable weight, pain, loss, trials. His integrity. His honesty. The confidence with which he walks through life knowing God will carry him through. The way his relationship works with the Lord astounds me. His whole hearted desire to seek help and strength from Him. His humor. How he always always knows how to make me laugh in a way that only he gets. His gentleness. Generosity. And his compassion. It is absolutely astounding how big his heart is. He seeks only to love others. To help others. But lets no one help him. His wariness to let people in and trust people makes him so alluring in a way that he doesn’t even know is dangerous. Because my heart wants to help just as bad and I feel in my heart and know in my bones exactly how to help him. To let him lean on someone. To not carry the weight of the world on his shoulders. Its almost painful. The passion I see, hear, and feel from his music. It’s his outlet. His heart. His safe place. His home. Just as it is mine. His music speaks volumes and at a level that only I know I can hear. It’s captivating. His patience with which he walks through life. Through troubles. Through relationships. His disease. The grace that he puts on his face but deep down I know how much it hurts. His scars. His sweet smile and face and everything about him screams perfectly imperfect. Sideways smile. Broken nose. Lopsided, lazy, deep hazel eyes. He kills me. And I think the thing that makes him so dangerous, the reason I started to fall in the first place, is the taste I had of him. For those 6 months. That short, sweet taste I had. This “what if”. The endless possibilities. I crave him from my bones to my fingertips and I cannot shake him and wouldn’t want to even if I could. And the thought that he makes me feel this way, from the minimal amount of time I spend with him, imagine what he’d do to me if he was mine. A single touch unravels me.

52,How to Love,"# Introduction or How NOT to Love

Sometimes after having an occasional conversation with a person you have met recently, you come back home, fall into your bed with mixed feelings. You can’t stop but think about her (him). The way she talks, the way she moves is so much different than other girls you have met before. She has something special in her; it hypnotizes you. Each time you meet, her dark black hair mesmerizes you, her tanned skin, as soft as the silk of her dress disturbs your soul.

You act differently around her. It is not your usual behavior, you are more attentive, more reactive, overthink about her interactions with you, overanalyze your dialogues with her. You would like her to love you back, but you don’t see any signs of her love. You act dumb sometimes around her and you don’t understand why. You are not yourself around her.

You show her photo to your friends, telling how attractive she is. At times they agree, but, usually, they just tell you – “yes, she is kinda cute”. You try to find a good answer after some reconsideration – “well, you don’t know her closely”. As if you know her close enough.

Time passes by… She is friendly, but she doesn’t seem like loving you back. She has also occupied your mind completely. You are conquered. You cannot help but think about her whole day, you cannot do anything productive, but to daydream about the future you are going to have with her. You are also fucked, but you don’t know that yet.

If you had more than one similar experiences, you know that she will never be yours. But somehow you cannot help but struggle in total pain with that one-sided love.

Did similar experience happen to you? Maybe it is currently happening. In either case, you are not alone.

That is how you should NOT love. I can assure you, after some years, you will look back and hate yourself for wasting so much time on unsuccessfully attempting to get the heart of your beloved one.

Before getting into talking about how to love, let me explain some notions below.

## Subjective Beauty

Beauty is indeed just in your thoughts. It is subjective. Show me a photo who you consider beautiful, and unless it is Angelina Jolie’s photo, there is a chance that I might object you. I can tell, “yes, she is cute, but for me not so beautiful”. Furthermore, someone may even object that even young Angelina Jolie is not hot enough.

Beauty is subjective. Media made us believe that slim means beautiful, however, it was not always like that. However, by simply looking at the art pieces of the Renaissance period, we can notice that the naked women depicted there are not as slim as supermodels today. The idea of beauty has changed over time.

## Idealization

You have an image of an ideal lover in your mind. Sometimes, you think that you are falling in love. However, it is usually no more than falling in love with the *idea* about the person who resembled your *ideal*. To put it differently, you begin to love the *image of the person* who seemed to be close to your ideal, rather than the *person* herself.

As the first step, you should realize that **there is no IDEAL.** It is only in your imagination. All the women (men), you will fall in love throughout your life, will resemble you that ideal. It is painful to accept that the ideal is only in your imagination and nothing more, but when you accept it, you are free.

Nevertheless, if the ideal is in your imagination, then no one is ideal in reality. But where did all these love stories go? Wasn’t Romeo ideal for Juliet? If not, why ‘Romeo &amp; Juliet’ has become an epitome of love stories?

The problem with Romeo and Juliet is obvious. Why Shakespeare’s the most famous play is THE love story? Because they loved each other madly? But there was more: *they could not reach each other.* They were not allowed to be together, and when they were in separation they would fantasize about each other, make their lover similar to their ideal. With the happy ending, I can assure you, the story would turn into modern day why-can’t-we-love-each-other-after-marriage-like-we-used-to story, desperately attempting to imitate romance movies of Hollywood.

Every time you begin to fall in love and think that “oh my god this person is ideal for me”, remind yourself how many times before you thought like this about a different person. And later, how many times you realized that it was incorrect. Think about it, if you still have doubts.

## Conclusion or How to Love

You can learn how to love from poetry. Below are some lines from Pablo Neruda’s famous poem [‘If you forget me’:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5yADgMzGJo)

&gt;*“If little by little you stop loving me*  
*I shall stop loving you little by little”.*  
*…*  
*“My love feeds on your love, beloved”.*

Love a person who loves you.

It does not mean that you should love every person who is in love with you. It simply means that, when you are attracted to someone and find yourself idealizing that person, stop. Try to seduce her (him), but do not make her your goddess or your only option. Seduce her like Don Juan, and when you feel like she is also falling in love with you, or to put it differently, she is beginning to idealize you, seduce her more. When she is in complete love with you, let your mind wander, let it idealize the image of a woman who idealizes your image. Now you are Romeo and she is your Juliet, and unless she does not affect your life negatively (occupy your thoughts whole day and make you unproductive, take all your time, etc.), you are doing your idealization right.

**Love her madly, but without forgetting that you are loving her image in your brain, not the real her.**

And when something bad happens, when her love suddenly disappears and you don’t understand why, accept it. Do not make her love you as she used to, as it will not happen. *You cannot make someone fall in love with you* (although you can try to seduce, and if you are experienced enough, succeed most of the time). Embrace the pain when she no longer loves you, as “your love feeds on her love”, and if there is no love for you remained in her, you should kill the love in you towards her as well. It is painful, but it is also called maturity. After you accept it, [you can write the saddest lines](https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/tonight-i-can-write-the-saddest-lines/) and cry. But be sure in one thing, the next day you will feel much better.

55,I’m so afraid.,"I (26M) told one of my closest friends (26F) that I have liked her as more than a friend for about  4 years now, (known her for 5) last night. We haven’t seen each other in over two years after I moved out of the country. We hadn’t talked much in those two years, due to me dealing with major depression and other self confidence issues, and her being super busy after getting out of the military (that’s how we met, both stationed together). She messaged me out of the blue a few months ago, knowing that I live in England now, to see what I was doing just after New Years and it happened that I was going to be in Edinburgh right when she was passing through on a vacation with her sister. We agreed to meet up, and when she and I did, we both got breakfast (her sister was sick so slept in for a little bit that day) and it was like nothing had changed between us, even though we had both been through an incredible amount of difficult situations. 

Later that night we are at pub, and both had a couple drinks so we were feeling really relaxed, but not drunk, and we had a pretty deep talk about what we wanted in relationships and kids, and our views on life and etc, and we were both just connecting so much, it got to the point where I thought that this was meant to be. I had never really experienced it before and only deepened how much I really liked her, and in reality I love her, but anyways, nothing happens that first night.

The next day which was yesterday we do a bunch of sightseeing and stuff and we are both really enjoying it, and we end up at a really awesome dive bar. I get a really good buzz going and we both are in the corner of the pub talking with this older Scottish guy. He happens to remark, after she and I got into a really playful argument about something silly, (we weren’t arguing, just both very stubborn and wouldn’t concede to the other), that we are a cute couple. Now this is the third time in two days this has happened, first when she and I had breakfast the first morning, and older lady said “Looked really cute together, at dinner the second night, the waiter told me I was a “Lucky guy” and assumed we were on a date since it was the two of us for dinner, and now this and each time we both laugh it off as “we are just friends” but he then remarks that we both still really like each other a lot obviously, because we got along so well. Well at this moment I just blurt out something along the lines of “Well, yeah I’ve really liked you for a long time.” She gives me this shocked/puzzled look and I come out and say, “I’ve liked you as more than a friend for a long time. At this point she is completely shocked and says she had no clue. 

Now this is a good time to say, I hold my emotions in very well, so it didn’t surprise me she didn’t know, but at this point I let everything out, which I was nervous about because I didn’t want to scare her away, I told her every time I tried to work up the courage to tell her previously, including the time she taught me how to dance, and I got to over confident and dropped her when I went for a spin and dip. The plan was supposed to nail it and when she came back up, to kiss her. But obviously it didn’t happen and not to long after she got into a relationship with a guy who ended up really hurting her emotionally. But by that time I was gone and didn’t really know how to be there for her from a long distance. 

Back to the present. At this point, she knows I’ve dealt with depression and self confidence issues, and so I explain that’s why I’ve never been able to express how I felt until now, and that while I haven’t been just sitting around longing for her, I’ve never let how I’ve felt go away. And I make it clear that it’s because of who she is as a person. She makes me want to move mountains, not just for her, but for myself, she makes me want to be just an overall better person, just by being herself, and that it also helps that I think she is stunningly beautiful. 

And....she doesn’t really say how she feels either way about it. She says she is pretty overwhelmed about it all, which scares me. We both acknowledged that it would be a long distance thing for a long time, due to my military commitments, and her own commitments, but I make it clear I want to make it work if she does. She doesn’t say yes or no, which again scares me, but I’m fine with, because rushing anything like that is never good. I want her to be sure of what she wants, regardless of the outcome. 

The problem I’m facing is while on the outside I’m saying to myself and her that no matter what she says, I will be okay with it, the truth is, I don’t know if I will be. I’ve been alone a lot over the last 8 or 9 years. But I don’t want just any relationship. I want to be in one that is meaningful and I can see being with her would be. I know I have deep trust issues, but I trust her and that doesn’t happen easily. I want to say I’d be okay with it if she moved on and found someone else to make her smile and laugh and treat her how she deserves, which is like there is no one else in the world that matters at all, but I know I won’t be okay. All my life I’ve made sacrifices so others can be happy and I’ve told myself its okay, but it’s not anymore, I want to be selfish for once. 

She and her sister left today for the next part of their trip and I head home in a few hours, and I don’t know when I’ll see her again. I know she’ll message me at someone point so we can talk about everything, at least I really hope she will, but this waiting is killing me inside, but I don’t want to push her. I’m so tired of waiting and hoping and being hurt. I’m holding back tears every few minutes it seems, time is so slow right now. I held onto everything for so long, that I thought just having closure on it would help, but now I’m afraid I’ve opened up wounds that won’t heal again. I’m afraid if I get hurt again I won’t be able to really recover and never be able to really find anyone else.

I’m afraid I won’t ever be good enough for anyone, especially her, I’m so afraid.

58,"Wait, what?","I've been through a lot for the past two years with my ex and if there are a few things that I realize...

1. Even if we didn't end up together, our relationship was still worthy, it's still worth it. Because at some point, it was what we both wanted, we made it work somehow, and we made each other happy. No regrets. Just love. 
2. No matter how much effort we put into our relationship, no matter how hard we fight for it, if it's not meant to be - it will never be. We don't need to force a relationship that's already falling apart because in the end both of you will suffer. 
3. Never ever give all of your love to your partner. Save some for yourself. Because at the end of the day, when all else fails, all you have is yourself. Never let anyone take that love away from you. 

To my ex, if ever you're reading this, I know we had our fair share of shortcomings but I never had any hard feelings for you. I know we both did our part but still you chose to walk a different path and that's okay. I may not be still over you but I know I'll get there. It may take some time but I know, I will.

Thank you.

60,Beyond words,"I'm posting this from a throwaway account so my bf doesn't know it's me. I am so beyond in love with this man... I have never met a more kind and compassionate human. He is the reason I get up in the morning, literally. Every day we make sure to give one another a kiss goodbye before we rush out the door for our busy and long days at work. The minutes seem to drag on for hours when I'm not with him, but the hours feel like minutes when I do see him. It's the most amazing feeling coming home and knowing the first thing I'll see is him (and our beautiful dog). He is the love of my life. We're both recovering from our pasts but having his love and giving him my love has helped along the way. It's not always perfect and sometimes it takes extra effort... but at the end of the day hes my person. The one I want to pour my heart and soul into, he deserves all of the love and affection that this world has to offer. He truly deserves the world and I strive to give it to him every single day. I want to marry him, I want a future with him. I try to be a better human for him and I try to be my best self for him. Sometimes he doesn't feel like he deserves love and in those moments giving him extra love is beautiful. I want him to always know that he is deserving of true and genuine love.

Years ago I was in the worst situation of my life, in an absurdly abusive relationship, starving myself to look perfect for that asshole. It was heartbreaking and I am still recovering from the long term effects and stress he put me through. At my lowest I was hours from death hoping i would die to get away from that relationship. Looking back I'm shocked I survived and even more so that I got away from him.

Being with my man now has been pure bliss since the moment I laid my eyes on him. I knew he was the one for me. Hes asleep next to me right now snoring and I have never been more than in love. ",love,1546753132,throwawayacctthough,0,1,True,2019-01-06

66,Torn between 2 loves.,"I dated this Girl who was 3 years younger than me, we dated for almost 3 years. We began dating when she was broke. I put her back together and helped her get on her feet after watching a child (not hers) die in a car accident, she just happens to witness. We stayed an I knew I wanted to be with her. 2.7 years pass and we become stagnant, nothing new doing the same routine every day. It was boring but I knew I loved her. She is younger than me had a whole different kind of crowd to hang around. Anyways she wanted to grow on her own and explore, so she broke up with me. I was destroyed I didn't sleep, eat or anything for 2 months. Was almost fired multiple times from a good paying job because of my lack of performance.  Had a near death experience (not suicidal) from that moment on I lived for me jumped on dating services. After nothing, for about 3 weeks I get a message from a random girl on Tinder. Being new to the whole talking to girls with my single status was interesting wasn't very open at first. Not wanting to get hurt I didn't really open up but this girl was persistent and I opened up turns out we went to the same jr. high and knew the same people. Anyways we began to hang out and go on hikes, go out to dinner go exploring. Go to clubs etc. 
fast forward 3 months I'm crazy about this new girl she's awesome we do a lot of things together. And she says she loves me one night. And I say it back knowing I do.  I enjoy being with her. Doing things with her. I was enjoying life trying new things. Enjoying my time. Anyways I get a call from my Ex who I hadn't talked to for roughly 3 months. She says she wants to talk to me ( i unfriended her and her family from all social media) I ignore it when she gets our mutual friends involved. So I agree to meet her and talk. 
She says j was right about everything that she made a mistake and that she hopes she hasn't screwed up totally. I don't say anything. Say I'm more than happy to be friends but I'm happy where I'm at right now.
Fast forward 2 months she asks for coffee together I say sure cause she's been in the back of my mind. We talk and I agree that she can friend me on Instagram and Facebook. Now we have talked and she says she wants me back the new me. This is what I wanted was her back. But I'm with this new girl. I enjoy being with her, doing things with her. Ya, some of our views don't match. And yea I can't talk to her about certain things since she doesn't understand the subject. But I have this connection with the new girl. I want to be with her but at the same time, I've been given the opportunity to be with this woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. The same one that broke my heart the same one who tormented me in my sleep after the breakup.
I'm asked my friends what I should do. They say I should stick with the new girl because they saw the whole progress of me going through the breakup. But I have strong feelings for her. And when I imagine her leaving or not being in my life. I get sad. But at the same time. My ex's family is family to me., I can talk to her about a certain subject and she will understand. 

So I'm just lost. Do I stick with the new girl and see where it goes? 
Or
Do I go back to my Ex which is what I wanted in the beginning.",love,1546765971,TheKinkyMango,2,1,True,2019-01-06

It's hard work and it's a promise of commitment, honesty, and loyalty. I'm not going to lie, the past couple months have been hard. You lit up my days but often darkened my nights. For every smile you've given me, there was a tear when I was laying alone in the dark. For every reassurement you gave me that I was amazing, smart, beautiful, there was the question as to why I wasn't enough. I've questioned why I stayed, I'm not going to lie. The thought of leaving crossed my mind. The pain was great and there were many days when you weren't enough to make me forget it, even for a short time. I didn't leave however, not because of pity, but because somewhere along the way, I made the choice. The choice that despite the pain, you were worth it. That I'd be there for you, no matter in what way it was - friend, girlfriend, whatever. I made the choice, and especially now that we're through the worst of it, I'm going to stick with it.

76,Is my relationship bad?,"  

I wanna share with you something. I don’t know where to begin so I’ll just say the first thing that comes to my mind. I’m with a girl. We started dating more than a year ago. At that time, we’d known each other for 6 months. I was 19 and this is my first relationship. In fact, I never had sex with anyone else, I didn’t even kiss any other girl before her. I was waiting for the right one all the time. She’s the opposite of me. She kissed more than 10 guys, and slept with her boyfriend at the time when she was dating him and even slept with a girl after that. 

She has no mother. She died when my gf was a baby. Also her father is in jail. She was raised by her grandparents. She’s 18 now and I’m 20. When I met her and started to get to know her I was so pissed that life is so cruel to someone that young. She’s really different than me. She needs to be loved because she didn’t get the love when she was a kid. Her grandparents are rude to her. Not all the time but they never complaint her. They are not very kind. When she was with her ex, he gave her all the love she needed. He was the best person in the world for her. She was an anorectic because she was seeking attention from her grandparents, but things got out of control. She almost died and her ex was literally keeping her alive by loving her. Then after some time he didn’t feel the love anymore and he cheated on her with 3 different girls. She tried to save the relationship somehow but he told her that they could still sleep together but he broke up with her. She was so desperate that she slept with him for some time even after the break up until he found a new girlfriend. Gosh, how I hate what he did to her. She didn’t have any reason to live after that.. I know, it sounds stupid, but image what it feels like having no one. She tried to kill herself but failed. After some time she got better. The disease was gone and she got over her ex. At least that’s what she told me.

You know I’m that romantic kind of guy who wants to be with one girl for life. I waited for her. She didn’t do the same and I don’t say I’m not okay with that. That depends on the person and I don’t blame her for anything she did before me. But I have to admit that I feel sad about it sometimes. You know I wanted to have that one princess that waited for me too. But nowadays I think that’s impossible. It’s not a big deal tho. The thing that bothers me is that she’s still in contact with some of the guys she kissed. I met one of them and they still are too physical. There’s so much touching and I don’t feel comfortable about it. I talked to her about that and she said that she would stop. But then the guy came to her and they did it again. I know I might say too jealous, but it’s just the way I want my relationship to be. I want her to have only me. Not some guy who was there before me. But okay, if that makes her happy, I’m able to get over it too. There’s just one thing I don’t understand.

She keeps texting to her ex. I want to know your opinion about this. She just keeps sending him messages and he texts with her too. We talked about it and I said I don’t want her to be in touch with him anymore because I don’t like what he did to her, and of course, I don’t like him because he is her ex. She just told me that she wouldn’t let him get away from her life. I couldn’t sleep a few nights because I didn’t know what she would and wouldn’t do. Once I found a photo of him behind her cell phone cover. She didn’t say anything to it. I still don’t know the reason why she had it there.

Her ex wanted to meet me and talk about some stuff. We met at a ball where I went with my gf and he was there too. The sad thing is that she spent more time with him than with me there. I talked to him and told he I didn’t want them to be in contact anymore. He responded he wouldn’t leave her for the second time… After the ball me and by gf went to my place and that night she was different. She didn’t want to have sex with me and even in the bed she still kept texting him. I was super upset. I just couldn’t stand it.

You know she’s a complicated person. She lies too much. She lies to her grandparents all the time. They don’t even know me yet. After more than a year of our relationship. They haven’t met me. She just says they wouldn’t like me. She told me that they didn’t know her ex either… But after a year of our relationship I found out that she lied about it to me. Her grandparents knew him and they knew they were dating.

I also know that she liked his parents more than mine. When sometimes we talk about him, I say her that I don’t like that they are texting.. And she’s like we haven’t texted for a long time. But a few days later I see that notification on her phone with a message from him. On the other hand, I’m 100% sure she wouldn’t cheat on me with him. I also know that if I asked she would let me read all the messages. She gave me the password to her account but I’m not that kind of person who checks messages of their partner. Maybe I’m afraid I would find there something I didn’t wanna find? Who knows.

That’s the thing about her ex. I wanna say something more about her attitude to some things. As I said before, I’m kinda romantic guy and I like doing all that romantic stuff you see in movies. For our anniversary I had a cake made out of ingredients she likes and I threw petals all over the place and lighted candels. She really liked it. She gave me new watch which was really cool. And I like doing things like that for her. We live in different cities but sometimes when I’m in her city and she isn’t home I leave there a chocolate for her to find it (ofc I have to hide it so her grandparents don’t see it). Once I did something special for her and I was really proud of it. I went to Italy for 3 weeks because of work and we knew we wouldn’t see each other. I prepared for her a game where she had to find letters in different countries (where she lives, studies, works and so on). It took me really long to prepare it. I told her about it before I left. She started collecting those letters. At each of them, there was an important date for our relationship. First kiss, first sex, anniversary date…. and a short story how it happened. I was so proud of it but her reaction was like ehhh, I like you put some effort in it but there isn’t written anything new I wouldn’t know before. She dind’t collect all of them…  After that I was really sad and I don’t do things like that for her anymore.. not that often. No more surprising her with a rose or in front of the school.

I just realized it must look like I don’t even like her. I didn’t say a single positive thing about her. That’s not true of course. She’s amazing, she really beautiful, she is kind and loves helping other people and takes good care of them. That’s the way she is and I think that’s the way she still keeps texting her ex bf. And yeah, I forgot to say that she met him a few times without telling me. But I still knows she loves me. How she felt about him in the past.. I think she feels the same way about me now. I’m giving her the love she needs. But I also know that if I broke up with her she would kill herself. Sometimes when we fight she takes pills to help her with depression. She’s a nurse so she can get them in the hospital without prescription. I know it because when her ex left her she tried to commit suicide. 

When we started dating, a very bad disease came to her. She got cancer. Her life didn’t turn upside down tho.. She always felt like she wants to die and with that.. It was just the same. I kept telling her to keep fighting because of me. And she made it out of surgery where she had 30% chance to survive. I don’t wanna talk to it much but I had to mention it. She was fine for some time but few months ago it came back to her. She didn’t even tell me about it. She keeps many thing away from me and she brought it up when we had a fight.. That’s the only way how to get important information from her. Anyways, she’s still fighting now. I don’t know how it will go. She doesn’t talk to me about it. 

I wanna ask you guys (considering you read it to this point) what would you do? Would you break up with a person like this much sooner or would you do it now? Would you stay with her till the end? I know I will be there for her as her boyfriend as long as I can, but I wanna know opinions of other people. 

If you were at my place and would leave her know.. she would commit suicide. She tried to do it when she had cancer before. Also she’s not really a person you can trust because she constantly lies to her grandparents about not having a boyfriend and lies to me too. She keeps texting her bf and denies it. Also, once she wanted to cheat on me with my friend’s gf when she was drunk.. She’s not the best person in the world. But I know I’m not perfect too. For me it’s not really about my feelings anymore. It’s about her feelings and making her happy.

77,A different type of love,"     I’ve felt different types of love this year. Me and my boyfriend are making plans to be engaged by graduation, and his love is phenomenal. The familial love between me and my brother is supportive and reassuring. The platonic love I have for my friends is just crazy; they’re all such amazing people.

      But today, I went to my cousin’s christening. He’s only 3 months old, and the minute I saw him I loved him. I held him and felt a whole new type of love swell in my heart, and I couldn’t believe how strong it was. Now I’m really really excited to be aunt soon, and to eventually be a mom.

81,Why is being in love so hard? Or is it just me.,"I’ve never felt so passionately before. We knew each other years ago. It was just sex. She constantly disappointed me because she didn’t truly care about me. She stopped talking to me then started dating a girl almost immediately after. For two years. They lived together. I was obsessed with their relationship the whole time and why I wasn’t good enough even though I was dating too. I loved twice but nothing or no one really got her off my mind. She would reach out occasionally but I couldn’t bring myself to really reply. 

 It wasn’t until this year I let go. She texted me and I figured I had moved on enough to be some sort of friends. We had conversations and I found out her and her girlfriend broke up. We got together thinking it would be just sex again but started to like each other. 

Now We’ve been in  a relationship for a few months. And I can’t let go of the feeling I’m not good enough. I’m not sure if it’s because I’ve built up this feeling over the past two years and it’s hard to let go. Or there’s truth to it and she  doesn’t like me as much as she says she does. Am I just insecure? Is it for good reason? 

She believes I’m her soulmate and this was our path. We just weren’t supposed to be together then. I’m finding that hard to believe. Now that I know her, I’m in love with her. So so in love. I’ve never felt this way and it makes me feel out of control. She could really hurt me now. 

I just wanted to get this off my chest. I appreciate any comments. Any thoughts. I appreciate anyone who read this far.

[&lt;3](https://i.imgur.com/g1FC5aB.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

My friends and officemates namely, German and Princess will be having a date this weekend. German has been single for a very long time while Princess has been single for around 6 months. It all started from a joke, until such time, while having a lunch(which just happened today), they exchanged numbers and agreed to have a date this weekend. It will be this Saturday at 1PM. German also said that he will be at Princess' house 30 minutes ahead of time for their date. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, German is confused on how he will spend the date with Princess especially that this will be his first date after a very long time. Guys, do you have any suggestions and ideas for their first date?

Your response and comment is highly appreciated! Thanks!

85,I messed up.,"I was dating my best friend of 7-8+ years. I’ve known her since I was in middle school and we started dating when I was in college. 

She was 2 years younger than me but really mature so beautiful, so sweet, had such a pure heart. We had our own handshake, I was her first serious relationship. 

Well, long story short.. I broke her heart. She loved me, she gave me her all and I broke her heart soo bad.. I left her for this other girl she’s always warned me about. A girl she’s never liked, a girl she always said wanted to break us apart.

In the moment, I didn’t realize what I was doing. I was just being a stupid teenager not using my brain. Not thinking that I am hurting my best friend, a girl who has done nothing but love and care for me. 

So fast forward a few years later.. I am still currently dating the girl I left her for. This girl has done nothing but love me from day one. She’s all in, she sees a future with me, she wants to be married and have kids. She takes care of me, she’ll do anything for me. She’s a great girlfriend, any guy would be lucky to have her. 

Here’s my problem.. I cannot love her the way she wants me to love her. Why?.. because I feel so guilty breaking an innocent girls heart. I feel like I don’t deserve to be happy, not after what I’ve done. Ive sent my ex two deep apologies, from the bottom of my heart. The guilt eats me 2 years later.. I can’t love a girl that loves me unconditionally because I feel so guilty to love the girl that played a part in destroying my friendship and relationship. 

It’s not her fault, it’s mine and I take full responsibility for my actions a few years ago. I was a complete scumbag, I feel like such a horrible person. 

So here I am not being able to give all of my love to someone that loves me so much because I still feel guilty for losing my best friend. I wish I could go back and time and correct my wrongs. 

As much as I want to be happy and try to love my current girlfriend I can’t because seeing her reminds me of that guilt. I can’t move on from what I did because I’m dating the woman that reminds me of what I did every day. 

I miss my best friend and I could never get her back.  She was one of a kind and I feel like she was my soulmate. 

I’m breaking another girls heart because she doesn’t feel loved the way she should. 

Sorry for my grammar, sorry for my rant.

So there's this girl that i like and she likes me too but she has a boyfriend. In these past months we became very close with eachother, everything was doin fine until i realized one thing.. that i cannot continue this way. 

Her boyfriend is a friend of mine, and i don't want to be the reason of their breakup. I spoke to her about this, i said if she will breakup for me, doesn't mean the same will happen to us. I said that i just want her to be happy, even if it's not me, and i'm trying to save the friendship with her bf. If it's not meant to be one day, life goes on, but when i speak to her, i feel much better, and havin this feeling for the rest of my life, it would have been nice staying with her.

I know this will hurts, but i'm trying to become cold/distant with her, just a normal friend.. She already noticed this. 
Should i continue or is it wrong? This f*ckin hurts me but i think it's the right thing to do.
I just want her to be happy, i don't want to influence their relationship for my desire.

I am 25 years old and so now and than all the friends of my parents meet up and have a dinner. 

Sometimes it's at our home and the other times at someone else their homes.

However there is this one lady who keeps checking me out and act very kind to me. From her gesture it is obvious she is into me.

Unconsiously she behaves a certain way in her acting when I am around and the husband gives me dirty looks. 

I try to play it cool amd ignore it. And look at random stuff inside the home or pretend to listen to the conversation of the older folks.

My question is: 

How can I avoid this whenever I meet this lady? I don't want to flirt a married woman back... (because I think of the husband his feelings, you know empath)

Ps. She told my mom from all my siblings she has a special place for me in her heart?!?

101,"Loving unselfishly, a lesson I learned too late.","From Napoleon Hill:

""Love walks hand in hand with peace of mind.  A couple who truly love one another often reflect that love upon the world like a beacon of happiness.  They 'belong to each other,' we say, and in many ways they do.  Yet look beyond the trite statement and you will see that belonging is not the same as selfishly possessing.  One who really loves another does not hold his mate in chains of jealousy, for this is fear, fear of the loss of love.  True love knows no fear.""

I miss you too my love, and I release you from my selfishness.  I have been loving you as a belonging for the last year and now I know that why we both still ""don't.""

Then one day, for no particular reason, you came into my life.

The cork holding back emotions, dull knives, lost guitar picks, and fireflies exploded my core with a sweet, agonizing pain that I had never felt before.

I knew what I had to say.

So one day, for no particular reason, I told you I loved you.

And when you said it back, my heart beat so fast that I almost had a heart attack.

With my tears on my cheeks and my heart on my sleeve, you told me you would never leave.

That you would never go away.

And then one day, much to my dismay, for no particular reason at all, you left.

You lied to my face.

You ripped my heart out and shattered it in a million pieces despite telling me you'd never.

As if you were the glue holding it together.

I can't sleep.

I can't eat.

I don't feel anything anymore.

Me -- lying alone on a locked bathroom floor.

You -- a million miles out the door in some bullshit other place.

I will love you as a drawer loves a secret compartment, and as a secret compartment loves a secret, and as a secret loves to make a person gasp, and as a gasping person loves a glass of brandy to calm their nerves, and as a glass of brandy loves to shatter on the floor, and as the noise of glass shattering loves to make someone else gasp, and as someone else gasping loves a nearby desk to lean against, even if leaning against it presses a lever that loves to open a drawer and reveal a secret compartment. I will love you until all such compartments are discovered and opened, and until all the secrets have gone gasping into the world. 

I will love you until all the codes and hearts have been broken and until every anagram and egg has been unscrambled. I will love you until every fire is extinguished and until every home is rebuilt form the handsomest and most susceptible of woods, and until every criminal is handcuffed by the laziest of policemen. 

I will love you until M. hates snakes and J. hates grammar, and I will love you until C. realizes S. is not worthy of his love and N. realizes he is not worthy of the V.

I will love you as we grow older, which has just happened, and has happened again, and happened several days ago, continuously, and then several years before that, and will continue to happen as the spinning hands of every clock and the flipping pages of every calendar mark the passage of time, except for the clocks that people have forgotten to wind and the calendars that people have forgotten to place in a highly visible area. I will love you as we find ourselves farther and farther from one another, where once we were so close that we could slip the curved straw, and the long, slender spoon, between our lips and fingers respectively. I will love you until the chances of us running into one another slip from skim to zero, and until your face is fogged by distant memory, and your memory faced by distant fog, and your fog memorized by a distant face, and your distance distanced by the memorized memory of a foggy fog. 

I will love you no matter where you go and who you see, no matter where you avoid and who you don’t see, and no matter who sees you avoiding where you go. I will love you no matter what happens to you, and no matter how I discover what happens to you, and no matter what happens to me as I discover this, and no matter how I am discovered after what happens to me happens to me as I am discovering this. I will love you if you don’t marry me. I will love you if you marry someone else – your co-star, perhaps, or Y., or even O., or anyone Z. through A., even R. although sadly I believe it will be quite some time before two women can be allowed to marry – and I will love you if you have a child, and I will love you if you have two children, or three children, or even more, although I personally think three is plenty, and I will love you if you never marry at all, and never have children, and spend your years wishing you had married me after all, and I must say that on late, cold nights I prefer this scenario out of all the scenarios I have mentioned.

I convinced myself to buy a ticket to see her and in February I did that but something happened days before my flight.... my brother got sick and I didn’t go! My heart was hurting cause of him and secretly cause I missed out on my chance to meet her and I thought she would stop talking to me... I naturally pushed her away like I did with everyone when I get afraid but.... she didn’t take no she stuck with me and still treated me like gold even after canceling.... even after pushing her away.... I felt so much appreciation for her I Never been this accepted by someone I continued to talk to her and told a lie saying I had another ticket for April but I didn’t have enough money! I was so scared about losing her even tho I didn’t know I liked her.... I worked my ass off 6 days a week full time shifts! Nicole and dimes! But I was still so unsure of going now.... Would this amazing girl really like me .... if I went would she look at me the same in person!! What if we don’t like each other in person and what we have now is gone... I had to do it I booked my ticket and we continued on for the next month growing closer... when she was down she would call me crying I would comfort her and we cried together about life... we both needed each other... then game time to meet this girl... I never have been to Paris before I boarded a plane to Paris so scared and excited!! When I got to Paris I was so sick ... from all the stress here I am about to cancel on her in the hostel in Paris but something told me not too! Don’t do it! You need to see her and then came the text “I’m here downstairs” I went downstairs when I saw her... my pain the pain that made me fall to floor was gone! I went for a walk with her... Hahahah some how we ended up with kiwis and a cucumber that we would keep all night (inside joke) as the day ended we watched the sunset at Louvre and we walked to Norte dame just talking and loving life when we got there we had a heart to heart and I looked Into her eyes and my heart just exploded and i had no idea until now that’s what happened... Some how we ended up skipping down the streets of Paris and ..... holding hands we went to a bar to get shots like we always talked about and then went out to find her friends.... but we never found them we spent 5 hours walking around holding hands just looking at each other.... still so oblivious to knowing we like each other!! We walked around till 4 am and then we went back to the hostel and we rested the next day we walked around holding hands again! And we had a talk... she told me that no one has ever bought her a rose before and looked up where flower shops were and I secretly took her there and I got her.... her first rose and that moment I realized I liked her.... I was shocked and we spent the rest of day walking around talking while secretly inside my head I was battling with myself cause I was mad.... I thought my feelings would mess this up... we ended up at the top of Montmartre hill! Laying down for sunset and some how we needed up feeling each other’s heart beats and I missed the sunset we had laying there for 3 hours feeling each other’s heartbeats when I slipped out .... “I like you” she was stunned and said “it’s ok” hahah  but as soon as I heard that I went down and tried I walk her back to hostel so I could leave her alone I was so hurt but I didn’t realize that she was ist so shocked and after a few minutes she realized she liked me and she tried to tell me but I wouldn’t listen we would end up crying on benches that night.... me telling her that I won’t talk to her anymore..... I would block her...... we got back to hostel and she gave me a essay talking about al the amazing things about me.... it was 6 pages long and then I left her crying on a stairwell in st Christopher’s inn..... as soon as I left I realized I made a mistake I ran back down the stairs but she was gone and I missed my shot...... I hurt her so much..... I messed up so much! But for some reason she still messaged me the next day with forgiveness... even tho I hurt her.... I worked my ass off the next two weeks trying to let her know her worth and next thing you know i was dating her and i flew back again a few weeks later to see her and we shared our first kiss under the Paris stars.... then she came back home and from July to now (January) she’s made me feel so loved and so safe.... so happy!! We’ve travelled all around the world since July she’s slept on me and made me feel so whole..... she’s the girl that makes me smile everyday.... In November I learned I’ll be going with the military.... leaving her behind..... I have a choice to go or no I said yes!  for the next two months I spent more time with her ..... surprising her with a trip to Paris.. the place we met.... she cried that I would do that for her.... ever since then I’ve been second guessing it... I’m so lost right now I have 4 days before I go to BMQ and i can’t sleep today we spent time and she cried so much... my heart broke so much I can’t imagine. Not seeing her for long time but after I will move far away from her forever.... idk if I can do that..... am I just young and dumb in love. Or does this person deserve my heart..... I know she does! I need her... I was so lost without her and knowing I’ll lose her is making me crumble I can’t think anymore...... I’m terrible rn! I’m crying everyday all day! I need her today when I say her was the only day in 3 days I smiled!! She told me the same she is so sad rn and her life is just coming together but she stressed and she told me she needs me to be there for her cause I calm her down..... but I learned I can’t talk to her au point during the day and for only 30 mins at night ..... I think I messed up! I know everyone says don’t give up stuff for girls but If i lose her cause of this idk what I’ll do..... I’m scared and so is she..... the military is suppose to break you down and build you stronger but she did the same thing but with her heart.... she’s my butterfly and I need her ",love,1546924094,hockeymang7689,1,1,True,2019-01-08

110,How do people handle the changes their S/O goes through physically and mentally?,"I’ve had issues in the past with being able to accept people the way they are physically and mentally dating wise, call me shallow
 
But now I’ve opened up my mind to the idea of accepting people and they’re flaws and love them anyway.
So I quit porn all together for ever because I knew it would help

There’s this girl that is perfect for me, but physical attraction wasn’t that strong, and I thought to myself
If I could just get over this silly physical part, I’d be eternally happy with her.

My thoughts went back and forth, if I’m shallow, or I’ve just been picking the wrong people, maybe depresión gets in the way sometimes makes me anxious and doubt my choices.
All I know is I need to think this through calmly, and with enough compassion for myself

Of course everyone has their standards and preferences, about who they choose
But how far do preferences go, to when they become unhealthy

It got me thinking, if the persons body or mind starts to change, years into the relationship, they start to get fat, or they become less adventurous, or start drinking more and get a gut

Then they’re no longer the person you fell in love with right?
Sometimes I get know couples, and gets me curious
“How can you be physically attracted this person anymore?”
They don’t meet their initial physical preference anymore, and it confuses me.

There are things I can accept, if my wife got fat from being pregnant, or getting old, I get it.
Your body and mind can’t stay the same forever

Do people initially fall in love so much physically and mentally, that physical no longer becomes relevant down the line?
Does love just bypass all that somehow?

116,It's fair to say that it's all gone with the wind ..,"An old friend contacted me last summer,it has been a while we haven't talked before so we started catching up again and before we realize it we were talking for hours every night.. and i won't lie it was a breath of fresh air for both of us, we knew we were more than friends and less than lovers &amp; i know it's not a friend zone situation because we knew we wanted more from each other,even started plans so we can see where this is going,or that time when she was really tired and sleepy and she told me what scenario she was playing over and over in her head which was me proposing to her and she fell asleep , she asked me the next day if she said something and i told her and i actually said it would be great and she was excited about it ,we had great relationship dynamics, whether it was only friendship or something more, whatever it was it was great,the kind of dynamic that energizes you ,and it really felt great.

Lately, she suddenly started keeping her distance,and i wasn't stupid about it &amp; i gave her the space she needed and after a while i tried to understand what's going on she said was confused by everything and doesn't have a clear answer for me which never happened before, she said i did nothing wrong and that she looked at all the possibilities and she still doesn't have an answer, but i only wanted her company that's all... but here we are now ,from endless presence in each other's days and nights to simple interactions. Anyway i'm not blaming her,i'm sure she had her reasons although i'm sure it's nothing we couldn't handle together but i guess we'll never know ..

So it's been kinda awkward especially knowing that there's more to us, i mean only couple of nights ago she reached out &amp; we talked and i just was being my self with her and she was feeling really comfortable and talking and it's like she forced her self to stop talking me &amp; wished me a good night and went to sleep and the day after she was avoiding me.

Anyway,i miss her presence i know i do but i have no questions about it i just accepted it. What a shame for such an awesome connection to be overlooked like that,because i tried my best i know that but i can't force her to stay,after all i too have had my fair share of shit in my life.

Despite the distance we still always find ourselves in frequent communication. I recently told him I have feelings for him and he suggested we go on a trip together. 

We are planning the trip and have already made investments towards our weekend together! I’m just really excited and nervous about the possibilities with this. 

He hasn’t expressed his interest but he suggested the trip and is the main one to keep up communication even though we are only together (as FWBs) once a year when he comes home to visit.

I'm yours if you don't say a word when you see me on the street.

130,Making love is the most beautiful experience...,"Once again, my boyfriend has left me drunk off of his love. We just had an amazing night of deep, slow lovemaking and my heart feels like it could burst. In our seven years together, we have had lots of sex...but tonight was just really special. The entire time we were wrapped up tight in each other's arms, him  deep inside me, thrusting ever so slowly every once and awhile. The deepest sex I've ever had...so deep it hurt a little at one point. But it was so special. As we held each other tight, we whispered I love you to each other over and over, hugging tighter with each profession of our love. Running our fingers through each other's hair, him holding me in the tightest embrace I've ever felt, his loving words whispered in my ear, the pressure I felt deep inside me....we were in our own little heaven. Pulling back to look into each other's eyes and just staring at each other and smiling. I can't help but smile when I look at him. He's my entire world. He said the sweetest, most loving things to me tonight. At one point he stopped thrusting from the bottom, flipped me into my back, got on top of me, and as he slowly slid inside me, he wrapped me in his arms and looked me in the eyes saying ""I love you so much"". Then he leaked down and whispered in my ear so softly ""I'm going to marry you"" and made the sweetest, slowest, most meaningful love to me. Every thrust, every French kiss, every tight hug...had so much love behind it. I was so overwhelmed by his love that I cried happy tears  into his shoulder as he cradled me in his arms and we made love extra slow. We made the decision to stop taking my birth control and ever since, we have been having the most natural, passionate, loving sex we have ever had. The way it's meant to be, letting our bodies do what they were made to do. Nothing feels better than the way we melt together when we make love, the way our two hearts become one. I am getting chills just thinking about it. After seven years, I still get crazy butterflies when he gives me that look and I know it's about to happen. His kiss still makes me melt in his arms, and when he looks me in the eyes and smiles at me I still blush. He makes me feel so safe and takes such good care of me. Reaching for his hand and feeling his familiar big, warm grasp is like a sigh of relief from the stress of the world. Falling into his embrace at the end of the day alone is worth living for. What we have is truly a gift from god and I feel so blessed and lucky to have a love like this. Making love with him is the most beautiful, pure, loving experience. Our love, combined with the intense sexual pleasure and our playful loving nature, creates a soul-melting experience that can hardly be put into words. True lovemaking is so beautiful and magical.

Currently, we are both busy falling in love and none of my relationships ever felt this good, easy, and comfortable. We are both so much alike, everything is perfect. However, I wouldn't be here if EVERYTHING was perfect I guess.

She has trust issues thanks to her ex and her absent dad. But the biggest issue she has is that she was sexually abused as a teenager.

She runs away when she feels vulnerable and feels truly close to a man. Right now, she is worried that she will ruin our relationship. She is scared of how great things are and she has a hard time letting go of her fears and past.

We had the most amazing day together just now and just before I was about to drop her back home, she got so scared about our future, and what will happen to me if she ends up hurting me, what if things don't work out between us.

I need advise from you guys, how should I handle her fears? What can I do?

135,The tragedy of being in love with your best friend who now has a girlfriend.,"Forgive me if I'm giving you the cold shoulder
I've just been trying to conquer my pain
you know life without you is unbearable
and I want to teach myself to deal with that when it finally happens

If you only knew how much self-control it takes to ignore you like that
I'm itching to talk to you every minute
it drains every power in me to suppress that
 
I want to go back to our old days
where time didn't matter
I talk to you and you talk back
No delays, no excuses and no drama

Now, everything is different
every minute you leave me hanging feels like eternity
I'm losing my mind
cause I think I'm losing you

Worst, is the realization that I don't own you
somebody owns your heart
and I have no power over that
I can't make you stay if you decide to leave

That is why I'm putting myself at a distance
I'm torturing myself in the process
but this is I think the best thing to do
to prepare me for the worst

my crippling anxiety is unforgiving
I feel like I'm all alone again
You have her and she has you
I'm all alone, I want to be used to it

your absence is pissing me off
everytime, every damn time
you, ignoring me, even though it's just an assumption most of the time, fuckin kills me

it angers me to think you're talking to her instead of me
it pains me that I can't even do anything to change that

cause you love her and she loves you back
and there's nothing more heartbreaking than seeing myself drown in that reality
and then there's me
I love you, I loved you first but you only see me as a friend

I'm not cool with that, even though I assured you I am
I admire you for being honest and straightforward
I guess it's my problem I can't fuckin handle the damn truth

You kept telling me, time and time again
I should have listened but I'm only hearing it and letting the words go
You're being fair, I am not
and I hate it

I know you somehow feel bad
everytime I joke about it
everytime I make fun of my pain

you see it
you see right through my words
and I feel that you really care about me
but not as much as you do to her

it's as if you don't want to see me hurting but you're not that invested enough to focus on me
to just focus on me
to let her go
to let her disappear from your life
like what I've been silently praying every night

that you'd grew some sense and see that I am enough
I was enough
and that I would be enough
that I am willing to give the world to you just to make you happy
just like what you've been wishing for 
all this time

from our late night conversations
to our nasty talks
I get you
You know me

we've shared our past relationship stories
we're both victims of our own past
we're the ones capable of loving unconditionally
we're the ones who are always left behind
I'm capable of loving you they way you wanted to be loved

we're so perfect for each other you know
but perfect I am to you is a best friend
while to me it's something more",love,1547050750,QueenLulu07,7,1,True,2019-01-09

137,This is just a jumble of my thoughts daily. Enjoy!,"We all know those people. Yes, the ones who were in and out of relationships after a couple of weeks. Jumping from one person to another trying to fill the void that the last had widened. Each attempt at a SO was to find someone who understood them and would NEVER disappear as if into a puff of smoke. 

Every time I’m walking around on campus I always see someone with a sour, or sad face. Some people would say: “that could just be their resting face so don’t worry about it.” After a while, you notice that rarely does someone look you in the eye or even grin. Being in pain myself, I understand where they are coming from. So I thought to myself, (don’t think of this as a self-righteous goal) if I can’t help myself then the best I can do is help make someone else’s day just a little bit better with a simple smile or a “hi”. You’d be surprised that something so simple can make somebody’s day better. I just want to be able to help someone who may not be able to help themselves like me. That feeling of helplessness, hopelessness, and sleeplessness is somewhat apparent, and I understand. I’m even sure some of YOU understand where I am coming from. Again, this may just be their face, but every single person can’t have a sour or sad face for a resting face. 

As for my heart, I’ve got a lot of love to give. Quiet a lot, as do most people. However, I have learned that I’m not good at choosing good wrapping paper for such a gift. So every attempt to connect with someone is difficult. By “wrapping paper”, I mean my personality and way of expressing my interests and feelings. I would be ecstatic if someone were to accept the gift that most definitely keeps on giving. Considering the struggles that people endure with love. I like to think of it like this:  if you are struggling to find love, there is a REASON for your struggles. Eventually, with the maturity and strength you have gained as a result of failed attempts at love, you will be able to use that fire for future endeavors of love. No, I’m not asking you to not feel pain and keep it all inside. If there’s anything I’m asking you to do, it is to feel. Feel anything! Pain, happiness, love, comfort, helplessness,kindness, loneliness, etc. I don’t wanna live in a world that is gray. I want to live in a world filled with colors. So, with the gift of love. Paint color into someone’s gray world. 

This was a jumble of what I have been thinking about for the past few months. Thank you for reading!",love,1547066369,77tabman,0,1,True,2019-01-09
138,The only girl I’ve ever fallen in love with...,"Sorry for the not so tidy grammar and the possible lack of proper language, I’m no author, just wanted to get this off my chest.

So I know this girl from elementary school, but we never really spoke because we were in separate classes. Anyway, I haven’t seen her in like 7 years or something until this club party almost a year ago, where we both were. I never really believed in love at first sight, and it wasn’t actually the first time I’ve seen her, but I believe in it from that moment. I’ve never seen her true beauty like that and I wanted to get in contact with her. That night I didn’t have the guts to approach her properly, we spoke a little but that’s it. But still, we got in contact the weeks after. The way she talked and all our conversations made me fall in love only more than I already was. So in like, the following half year, I asked her out 3 times. And she refused quite politely. I’ve had some time to try to get her out of my head. Deleted her number, snapchat, blocked her Instagram, everything. But after a month I was still in love, not even a small difference with before. 

Two weeks ago, we had a night out with our half combined group of friends. It was 7:00 in the night when we all went home, she didn’t have her bicycle with her so she rode with me. We talked for the whole ride and it was so nice, I got to bring her to her home. Now I’m constantly thinking of meeting her again but I don’t know how. Maybe you guys have some advice.

139,Why do we associate the heart with love?," Thought this might be interesting for some here... It's a cartoon short story with a theory on why we associate the heart symbolism with love.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaPdv2Cs4Qk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaPdv2Cs4Qk)

Would like to read your theories on why we use heart symbols as a way to express love sentiment. Why wouldn't we use a symbol related to genitals or another organ? Also, if someone knows if there are other symbols used in different cultures that would be fun to know.

Please post your theories and lots of love to you (making heart-shaped hands)!",love,1547072475,MrDominu,1,1,True,2019-01-09

142,Is 16 the right age to start having sex?,"Hello!
I'm a 16 year old girl. I've been dating my boyfriend (17 yo guy) for some time, and we are very close. Luckily, our relationship is quite stable. 
I'm a virgin, and so is he. He never pressured me into having sex, but we have already talked about it. I suppose it's going to happen in ca. 2 months. I'm going to start using contraceptive pills, and he's going to use a condom.
I feel physically and mentally ready to have sex. 
Both of our families are aware that we are dating, if that matters.
I'm aware of the dangers that sex might bring: neither of us have STDs.
And about pregnancy, I decided that if it happens, I'm definitely not going to get an abortion. I'd figure things out somehow but I wouldn't get rid of the baby, and my boyfriend approved my choice. 
I know that I still need to have the real talk about possible pregnancy with him.

At what age did you start having sex? Is 16 alright? I believe it is, I feel ready and he does too.

The kind that breaks you and makes you new again. I know I have this love.

“I think you’d be a perfect marshmallow” 
To which she replied with
“Implying I’m not already perfect?”
She said this because I’d called her perfect before. And what I then said I’m super proud of and I’ll probably never be able so say something like this again, but it is how I really feel. I said:
“I don’t think you understand how I feel about you. I don’t care if your a marshmallow or a string bean, if you change then my perception of perfection will also change”

148,Im (f29) embarrassed of the way my relationship with my FWB started. Is it as bad as I think it is?,"**TL;DR Moved in with FWB, embarrassed to tell people when they ask how our journey was.**

I cant tell friends and family how we started our journey, and therefor I have to get this off my chest. Its so embarrassing. Just my two best friends now. And one of his i think.

Im a female who is 29 years old and live in Denmark. 

* In 2008 I (now f29) met a boy (now m31) when I was at a pre-party. We got to know each other and started smoking some weed and hooking up.
* August 2008 I moved. Both of us got partners. We had some contact, but not a lot.
* When I was done with college in 2015 I broke up with my BF (now m32) and moved back home.
* February 2017 he sendt me a message through facebook. He was miserable in a relationship were they both grew apart and fight a lot. 
* We sent a lot of messages and hooked up again Easter 2017. We met once a month. 
* I was his side chick until december 2017.
* I´ve had some commitment issues, so that he was in a relationship was good for me. We got FWBs in january. I´ve encouraged him hooking up with other girls for the same reason, and because I know how you feel after a long time relationship (3 years)

He lived life as a single man, got Tinder, and I + another girl ended up being his FWBs until july 2018. He ended it with her since me and him were together 24/7. We have seen each other every day since july. I lied to him in june and told him that I was hanging out (BJ, not sex) with another man. I hate that I lied about that. Hate it. He doesnt know. Really hate it and embarrassed. 

When he was at work he called when driving home so that I could come over right away. Every time he was on his way home. We would hook up, smoke weed and watch TV. After a while he wanted me to sleep over, and I did. 

In august 2018 he asked: “What are we?” and I panicked and started another topic.

I started getting used to this kind of relationship.

Since we saw each other every day he gave me a key so I did'nt have to wait at home when he was on his way home from work.

In september 2018 he invited me to Greece and we travelled there (I paid for my self if that matters). We both started getting a bit jealous when I saw him texting with a girl friend and I was texting with a boy friend, which made him jealous. And we later found out that these people actually were friends we forgot about how jealous we were.

In october 2018 I moved in with him. He tells me every day how happy he is. How much he loves me. Introduced me to all of his friends and family. We miss each other every day when we are working. We both love sex; anal, oral, vaginal, slapping, choking, hair pulling, spanking and I let him pee on me in the shower.

Both of us are on unsure about marriage and children. I think marriage is unnecessary because so many people get divorced. And children, three of my girl friend are pregnant. It looks like hell. Im open for adoption. But if he really really wants a baby I will have this as long as I get a cesarean section.

He has talked about both of these things. A few times a month he asks: “Should we get married?” and smiles. He smiles at me when we kiss, when I ask why, he says its because he is in love.

We have a wonderful relationship, but I hate the way we got together.

I met her one weekend and surprisingly we shared the same habits and personality so we clicked in a way

We met the day after and we expressed our feelings about our ex’s which kind of broke the comfort level ice...

However I’m falling for her but I feel she might just be playing me.. just a feeling 
She doesn’t reply the way she used to since we last met.. and I really wanna talk to her but controlling myself since i don’t wanna get hurt again. (Broke up from a serious relationship)

Please advice guys and girls... should i continue talking even though she replies late and doesn’t show much interest

Not my ex-lover, but the feeling of love again. I miss the thousands of little moments of giving for someone I love. Sure i miss the touch of someone but there's more that i desire. Cooking dinner for someone who simply makes a babbling fool of me, a smile from someone who will always be beautiful in my eyes, Her going to sleep smiling, me waking up early to fix her a good breakfast at the cost of my own are the things i miss endlessly.

Sure, love treated me like a fool. I was taken for granted and treated more like a butler than a boyfriend. Sure you had me in some problems, but i can't stay mad at you. Oh love how i long to have you once more.

Some may say I'm idealistic and naïve, and that isn't entirely wrong, but the love i love is made up of those moments, and I hope to have them again.

I surely hope theres someone out there for me, after all love (in my experience) is a million little favors and moments, all justified by the phrase ""because i love you"" and how i wish to give those to another.  No matter the amount of flowers and effort, i just want to care for and be cared for.

Oh love.

I need some advice !,"There’s this guy i was messing with from earlier of last year. Our little relationship was pretty messy and weird cause me and my sister were two-piecin at the time with him and his other friend and i ended up having sex with him right after we met. We talked for a week after that, and he cut me off. After several months of not hearing from eachother he started hitting me up again, constantly tryin to facetime me through his new number. We’ve been talking for almost 3 months now and he’s been calling me every night before we sleep. We’ve also previously went out for a few times and he would always pay for my meals and such. I’m assuming he kinda likes me but does not want to initiate anything now that he’s “a little older” (he’s 18 and i’m 17).  There would be times where he would try to flirt but mostly he tries to act “friendly”. And it’s just driving me crazyy cause i been into this boy since i met him; and also of course of the fact that there’s some sort of attachment {he was the one who took my virginity}. sooo to add more to that, I took him to his first rave in december and we were all up on each other.

182,I truly appreciate you beyond belief.,"First post for a while on here, but firstly I would like you guys to know I’m humbled that my last post reached #1 of the month. I really wasn’t expecting that but thank you everyone who updooted it! 

I didn’t believe in love at first sight until I met my wonderful girlfriend. It’s like all the stars aligned and I hit the jackpot in every single way with her. I never thought it was possible to be so alike with someone who wasn’t related to me by blood. I can’t put into words how seriously lucky I am to be with this girl. Our 2 year anniversary is approaching very quickly here on the 3rd of March, and I am so excited and have so much planned already! She’s changed me for the best. Before her, all I did was sit alone in my room and play video games literally all day and night. I didn’t have many friends at all, none that were close or wanted to talk to me. Nowadays, I have someone I wake up to and fall asleep with. I have a gaming buddy and someone who can constantly make me laugh. I have someone who makes me feel like I’m never truly alone, and she makes sure that I’m always feeling loved and happy. I literally can’t get enough of this feeling. Lots of people are skeptical about our relationship but I seriously feel like she is the one. In the end though, people will have their opinions and I will have mine, and I will stick to what makes me happy.

This part is for my adorable girl to read: I appreciate you. I appreciate you so fucking much. You’ve shaped me into the goofy, nerdy, happy guy that I am today and for once in my life I don’t dislike myself because of you. You saved me from my darkest times. You saved me from myself and you give me loads of confidence. You care about me so much and you help me with literally everything, when it comes to computer issues to mental/emotional/physical issues she has helped me with all of it. I wish you knew your worth, because I wouldn’t give up what we have for the world. I wish you were confident about your looks and body because oh my god could I go into pages of detail telling you how perfect I find both. Lastly, I wish there was a way I could express how grateful and appreciative I am of you, babe. Thank you for everything, I love you so much, and I’m beyond excited to see you this March. ❤️

185,The “I Love You” of Fools,"I lie in bed, feeling the pressure of her body on top of me. She’s short, so our feet can’t quite touch each other unless she lies on my stomach, which she could do, but instead chooses to lie on top of my heart.

I’ve asked her several times why she does this, and she says that the sound of my heartbeat is comforting. She says it’s always rumbling and pumping, like it wants to explode. I think she knows she’s the reason that happens, but I tell her anyway, and she answers with a deep kiss and the brightest smile I’ve ever seen in my life.

So, we lie in bed, her on top of me, our fingers intertwined tightly together, holding onto each other until our hands go numb, like we’re expecting something to pull us apart. 

We lie there, not a word spoken justice sound of our breathing, going back and forth. I can smell the scent from her hair and my commitment to stillness doubles, because why would someone ever want to walk away from the most intoxicating scent they’ve ever experienced? If Love had a fragrance, it would be hers.

Eventually, she does talk. About the things we have to do, how this is wasting time, how we should be getting on with our day, etc. and I chuckle lightly and say something or other about how we’ve got plenty of time to do all those things. She tilts her head up to look at me and beams, as if that was the exact answer she wanted to hear, pulling her hands away from mine and pushing her arms under and around me in a tight hug. I hug her back and we stay like this for a while, a perfect embrace, pushing our bodies closer, feeling each other’s heat, the touch of each other’s skin, until her lips part and a whisper escapes from inside. It’s a very small whisper, delivered with kindness and fragility, the kind of whisper that might fly away from a light breeze, its contents drifting away. And yet, it didn’t fly away to some uncharted land, but instead nestled itself comfortably in my ears, where it had found great power and strength for it was a whisper I had never heard, but a whisper that has made empires fall and led people to the brink of madness, 

A whisper I had never heard before and once I had my heart began beating faster, tears flowed from my eyes, the world looked more colorful and vivid and my senses flared up. Of course, after such an earth shattering whisper, I had to answer with one of my own, which came out less as a whisper and more of a choked gasp of joy and surprise which, while not quite as dignified, still got the idea across and it made her hug me tighter and draw tears of her own.

What was this fabled whisper and gasp? Just three little words: “I Love You”.

...

Unfortunately this is all a lie. None of it happened. I’ve never met anyone like this, I’ve never dated anyone and I’ve especially never felt myself burn up by saying I Love You. 

Why did I write all this? Well, I have to get my I Love You out somewhere and why not use it here? Keep it from dusting. After all, if I don’t use it occasionally when the time comes when I can use it for real I might forget it’s even there!

Hope you enjoyed it either way.",love,1547283805,DoctorOfCinema,9,1,True,2019-01-12

And broken trust,

You've built too many of it,

Around your innocent, kind, beautiful heart,

There are a lot of reasons why you've built up this walls,

It made you stronger, wiser and better,

But you have set it too high,

Too high enough that even for you cannot set it down,

Despite the walls you've built,

Despite how tough it is,

I will break it,

Despite how high it is,

I'll bring it down,

191,A poem I wrote for a girl,"A little background first. I went around Chicago asking hundreds of people how to describe love. I took those answers and made them into a poem for a girl I adore

Not even 500 strangers could explain love
Love was explained in hundreds of ways
Love is being brave
Love is being the best version of yourself
Love is all encompassing and selfless
Some people were hurt by love and said
Love is painful
Love is a loss of money
Love is why Sharon took the kids
A few even said love couldn't be explained
It's easier to describe water
It's a waste of time to even try
It's not just one kind
But I can prove them all wrong
Love is black/maroon hair
Love is doing it for the hell of it
Love is always laughing at fart jokes
Most importantly love last even after it ends

198,Is the New Century changing the definition of a Love and Relationship?,"Times have changed since transportation was less accessible and we were bound to our homes. With globalisation and  options opening up for people moving and working abroad often long-term in separate places this is bound to effect our family and love life. this will probably even increase to do so with further technological advancement.

So, the other day I (24M) was discussing with my female friend about some stuff we had in common regarding love life. We both travel a lot and have been living in different places, switching about three times a year. We shared our experiences with love while living abroad. Living temporarily in each place, love has gradually changed form and gotten a different meaning over time for both of us.

The thing is, we both can't start a long lasting relationships since our time being limited we have and long distance is definitely our thing. But still we find lovers that we would like to keep seeing if we didn't have to go at some point so what are we to do? So usually it ends up as a farewell until we hopefully meet again , because who knows if we'll find ourselves in the same place in the future. Sort of putting the connection indefinitely on hold.

The thing is we can't stop looking for love despite knowing that we have to leave at some point. That is no way to live and I can't resist starting something serious even though I know it doesn't make much sense. Otherwise I would be chronically lonely. So I've had to find a new way of going about this that suits to my lifestyle.

For me for example I met a girl in Taiwan who I loved spending time with while living there for 5 months. She gave me insight into her culture that no other person could have done for me the same way. We were sad when I had to leave but we kept connection. But we parted with a mutual agreement that if were to meet again we would pick up where we left off. So we met again in China later that year and had a blast. Unfortunately things got a little more serious there so it became a bit more complicated. I had to end what we had because we had different ideas of our relationship in the end. I can't say that I ever loved her, but spending time with her and feeling her presence even from afar I treasured a lot. You could say that this might be opportunistic and I felt a lot of regret afterwords. But I'm happy for what we had.

After this I was with another girl in a Platonic relationship while keeping contact with my Taiwanese love (Tbh I've always had a hard time finding the right word to call her) without having any bad conscience. this is so contrary to the ""older me"" who was in a relationship for 5 years who could barely bear the idea of being in an open relationship with her. But with my different lifestyle I've changed a lot.

It sounds a bit sleazy but this could mean having multiple open relationships in different countries could become more common, if you could call it a ""relationship"". Makes sense when you are constantly going different places. You could argue that that could barely be considered real love, but what is love if it can mean different things for each person? We all look for different things out of a relationship so this totally doesn't work for everyone, but what if our idea of love gradually changing until the concept changes completely? Is Romantism dead?

 I remember the first day I met you.. you were shy, kind and generous. I would laugh at your lifestyle because of my ego. I remember when we started hanging out I didn't trust you at all, you made me paranoid. I thought I was getting robbed when you pulled out your gun. You didn't Robb me though, you bought me McDonald's and smoked a blunt with me.

We were like Bonnie and Clyde and I was really digging the way you were running shit. I remember you cocked your pistol and told these fools not to disrespect my car . I remember I got robbed and you got my belongings back for me, I was speechless because I ain't never had a girl that fucked with me like that. I remember the crazy shit you put me through, and I don't regret it. I'd do it all again.

I miss your scent, I miss your voice, and I miss your touch and most of all I miss your sweet and charming nature. 

You're in prison now but not for long.. it's for the best. We're sober now and off the streets.

208,I'm skeptical bout love these days,"I've always wanted a boyfriend that can be my best friend. My soulmate. I've day dreamed bout how I'd find someone like that, but I feel like the 'soulmate' part is a lie. Hell, I can't even find a girl that's my soulmate, so how can I find a boyfriend that fits my soul? I'm saying this because girls and boys are raised differently . I feel like love is more like, initial attraction, justification of why you love em/ why their flaws are small and etc. I've dated 3 boys, liked 2 guys without dating em and stuff. I kind of crave someone that can have intelligent convos with me debating bout stuff but also sarcastic/ gets my sense of humor and stuff. Well, I have had the idea of that before.

I've noticed sth bout the people I date. When I date smart ones, they tend to be egotistical and I slowly start to dislike them. When I date the not so smart ones, they tend to be really nice but I feel the void for the intelligent convos. I'm not trying to show off, I just like someone that improves me, someone that makes me wanna learn more. So it's hard for me. Maybe I'm not fit for love. I do love my boyfriend, and I've loved my boyfriends before him too. It's just that I always feel some kind of void whenever I'm with someone, that feeling of 'maybe he's not really my soulmate'

I've come to a conclusion that there's no such thing as soulmates. Love is justification and attraction, and the rest is getting attached to a person. ",love,1547376767,NoemiNora,9,1,True,2019-01-13

214,"OK, im in love","Soooo, i have been a shy kid all my life and i am kinda happy that i finally discovered a place where i can express my emotions without the feeling of insecurity. Hello reddit!  I want to tell my story (our story). I go to school with this girl and we have met about 3 years ago. At first we didnt like each other that much but time past by and we somehow started messaging each other. 

At the beggining, it was only about homework or school projects. We didnt connect on any level and i didnt think anything of it. She was like every other person that contacted me before.

A year after that we started talking a lot. We were spending more time in school together and even going out together. She was a very close friend to me at that time and we talked about everything. About our feelings, our grades, our opinions, our solutions to problems and more. I need to say that she is one the popular girls and i started feeling more special because i was she even talked to me. I always thought that i am like every other guy or even below average in every aspect. However, i was feeling so happy being in her company not even realizing that i maybe liked her more than a friend.

I think i fell in love with her about 6 months ago. It was the summer break and we had more time to laugh, talk, fuck around and so on. From one moment, when we went out I just couldnt stop thinking about her. Her beauty, her smile, her beautiful eyes and the way they glow in certain moments, her face, her hair, her perfect body, her intelligence, her persistence. I was in love.

I started being forward to her. I had much deeper conversations with her, talking about passion and love. We started hugging, going on walks or to events together. Things escalated in the last couple of weeks. We were on a few dates (as i call them). She knows i really like her and i have kinda told her what i feel but she hasnt actually reacted to anything. I think she is really scared of commitment but she doesnt know that i would do anything for her.

Today, we are in a weird sitution. She definetely knows i like her but i think she is too afraid to talk to me about our friendship or realtionship. We dont talk the way we used before and i really want to change that. 

In these six months i had a lot of opportunities to be with other girls but i passed them because i know i like her more than anything. I want to be me with her and spend time with her. She is all i think about the hole day. I dont even look back when i see a hot girl or flirt with anyone cuz she is the one that i love. I want to be with her more than anything.

wow, it really feels good to get that off my chest and being able to express myself.

216,My girlfriend said she didnt have feelings for me beginning New Years,"So it's been about 2 days since she broke up with me. It's been a wild rollercoaster for us. I started liking her a year ago. We began talking in the upcoming end of school months. Everything was going well but we were like really nervous and awkward around each other, We barely hung out and to me it didn't seem like she wasn't interested. It comes to sometime where our conversations were severely dry and on the 4th of July we stopped talking to each other. I would occasionally ask her by snap chat what was wrong and I would never get a clear response. Two weeks before school started she finally decided to explain herself on why she hasn't been talking to me. She told me that she felt forced to like me by my friends hinting her that I liked her. She apologized for wasting my time. I was left with a broken heart,

    The new school year starts and I'm fine. I'm not thinking of her as much and I'm paying attention to myself. A month passes and a friend and I go to a soccer game. She was there. She began messaging me again. We slowly began getting closer to each other. She invited me to go to the fair with her and her friends for the week. My friend told me that she told him that her feelings for me grew back again once she started seeing me again. This is where I went wrong, I became attached to her more and more. We ended up going to homecoming together and started hanging out ever so slightly. 

Fast forward to November and we were so into each other. We weren't dating but we began saying ” I love you to each other”. We talked about how we wanted to snuggle and cuddle. Coming into December strong she would end up telling me one day that she wanted to get married and spend the rest of her life with me. We're 15 so there wasn't a chance that was going to happen lmao. She told me that I was the best thing that has happened to her and I truly felt like It was surely meant to be. She was played by someone I was once friends with but I stopped talking to them. We would occasionally argue but we would quickly recover and I would try to comfort as much as I could. 

Christmas break begins and we get 2 weeks off. Our first week was harsh bc we were arguing a lot. But we managed to hold on and we told each other that we loved each other. She would tell me that she felt like I didn't care as much bc I stopped doing all the sweet things I would do before. So I began doing it again. Only to know that the next two weeks I would question myself what I was doing wrong. She began talking to her friends online bc they haven't talked since last summer and I would barely get to talk to her. I felt like she was putting me to the side. I would tell her that I loved her and she wouldn't even mention anything. I told her that I missed talking to her. But it became to be the same continuous thing. She would wake up at 3pm and barely talk to me and would talk to her online friends until 7am. I felt like I was trying to hard. But before that we would talk about how we were scared that one of us would lose feelings for the other. She said that were probably fine and that we wouldn't have to worry about that bc we love each other so much. 

This past week I cried my soul out. I missed the old her so much. Days would go so slow bc we wouldnt talk at all. She was ignoring me and i would ask her what was wrong and she would saying that everything is okay. I would ask her if she wanted to drop me and she would ignore that topic entirely. I'd ask her throughout the week and nothing. Then it finally came to Friday. We had our names in our bios on ig and I checked her ig and she had removed mine. She told me a couple hrs later that she had lost feelings for me during new years bc we stopped talking as much. She hoped that they would come back once she started seeing me again.  

I had finally got the answer that I had been asking her for.  She told me that she didn't want to hurt me again so if her feelings for me came back she wouldn't try to get back with me. I told that I wouldn't let her back into my life regardless. I wasn't really sad but confused and disappointed. I gave her everything. I treated her like a queen. Only to be left with a hole in my heart and tears. 

She told me that her feelings for me were real. She told me that she told her friends she regretted dropping me in the summer. She promised me that it wasn't going to be like it did in the summer when she stopped talking to me. She lied

It took her a week for her feelings for me to be gone.

Now I'm hopefully not going to do the same mistake and fall in love in high school. ",love,1547399850,joecuping,1,1,True,2019-01-13

218,"Ok, im in love"," 

Soooo, i have been a shy kid all my life and i am kinda happy that i finally discovered a place where i can express my emotions without the feeling of insecurity. Hello reddit! I want to tell my story (our story). I go to school with this girl and we have met about 3 years ago. At first we didnt like each other that much but time past by and we somehow started messaging each other.

At the beggining, it was only about homework or school projects. We didnt connect on any level and i didnt think anything of it. She was like every other person that contacted me before.

A year after that we started talking a lot. We were spending more time in school together and even going out together. She was a very close friend to me at that time and we talked about everything. About our feelings, our grades, our opinions, our solutions to problems and more. I need to say that she is one the popular girls and i started feeling more special because i was she even talked to me. I always thought that i am like every other guy or even below average in every aspect. However, i was feeling so happy being in her company not even realizing that i maybe liked her more than a friend.

I think i fell in love with her about 6 months ago. It was the summer break and we had more time to laugh, talk, fuck around and so on. From one moment, when we went out I just couldnt stop thinking about her. Her beauty, her smile, her beautiful eyes and the way they glow in certain moments, her face, her hair, her perfect body, her intelligence, her persistence. I was in love.

I started being forward to her. I had much deeper conversations with her, talking about passion and love. We started hugging, going on walks or to events together. Things escalated in the last couple of weeks. We were on a few dates (as i call them). She knows i really like her and i have kinda told her what i feel but she hasnt actually reacted to anything. I think she is really scared of commitment but she doesnt know that i would do anything for her.

Today, we are in a weird sitution. She definetely knows i like her but i think she is too afraid to talk to me about our friendship or realtionship. We dont talk the way we used before and i really want to change that.

In these six months i had a lot of opportunities to be with other girls but i passed them because i know i like her more than anything. I want to be me with her and spend time with her. She is all i think about the hole day. I dont even look back when i see a hot girl or flirt with anyone cuz she is the one that i love. I want to be with her more than anything.

wow, it really feels good to get that off my chest and being able to express myself.

Do u guys have any opinions or advice? I would really need one. Thank u for reading this.

220,Found the one,"I know this will most likely get lost in this sub but I felt like I just needed to write down my feelings.

I met this girl, through Tinder of all places lmfao. We instantly hit things off, I asked her if she'd like to goto a hookah lounge and afterwards goto the beach and star gaze while we get to know each other (my hopeless romantic self).

Suprisingly she said she wanted to but she was sick so we planned to hangout tomorrow. We texted all night long and we have so much in common such as our life story and previous relationships with abusive partners emotional/physical. We have common goals and ambitions, she's a successful entrepreneur and I'm in the process of becoming one as well but currently working as a delivery driver at a Hibachi restaurant. None of that mattered to her and she supports my journey to become what I want to do.

We became so attracted to each other's brains I honestly didn't even care that she's drop dead gorgeous, I was so boggled by how she gets my jokes, and likes the way I word stuff I could tell right then there she was special.

Fast forward we hangout the next day and I got to hear her talk and it's just the sweetest voice I've ever heard like I imagined. She has the piercing fierce amber/hazel eyes which are so big they should almost be in a cartoon, perfect full lips that looked like they'd lock just right with mine.",love,1547401378,Vanecrush,7,1,True,2019-01-13

223,So in love I have yet to find any flaws,"So I have been with my boyfriend for about 4 months now and he said I love you on New Years eve. Without hesitation i said it right back. I’ve been in love before but within like the first month I tend to find something that annoys me or sets me back a little bit. With this guy I can’t even stop smiling when I’m around him and it’s the most refreshing feeling in the world. I actually can’t believe I feel this way because I thought I had felt like this before but I was so wrong. I had just gotten out of a 2 year toxic relationship and I almost feel like my current boyfriend saved me. He has made me feel like the best version of myself and I’ve never been able to be my TRUE self with anyone else before. We talk about it all the time and it just gives me a crazy overwhelming feeling that I pray everyone can experience in their life. I love being in love. It’s just so crazy how one day someone can come into your life and change everything for the better. The best part is I enjoy hearing about his past, because it makes me understand him more as a person and with previous relationships I would get jealous and not really want to know things but with this guy it’s just like tell me everything!!! And there’s no jealously. In fact I’m thankful for everything that’s ever happened to both of us because it brought us together and we both agree that we’re simply incredible.

228,"Sometimes, Love is a strange journey.","I hardly know where to begin with this. This will be a long post. TLDR at the bottom. 

Ive always known that my wife was interested in women. She dated women casually in high school, but we got together in college and the rest was beautiful history. (I’m a man, btw). I was never bothered or threatened by my wife’s bisexuality. I always took it as a compliment. Out of the massive pool of people in the world she could have chosen, she ended up with me.  

Fast forward to a few months ago. After 8 years of marriage, my wife admits that she thinks she is actually a lesbian. She wants to separate and explore her desires for female sexual partners. Obviously this came as a blow to me and I have been coming to grips with this. In the next month or so, my wife will finally be moving out of our house. 

I should add that I harbor no ill will toward her. It’s not her fault that she is biologically inclined to be attracted to women. It’s not her fault that her religiously oppressive parents shamed her into being straight because “gayness is sinful.” She is still my best friend, I am hers, and we are trying to get along. It’s hard now, but long-term we still want to maintain a close platonic relationship. 

Now is where this weird story shifts. I’ve been casually looking around on OkCupid. I don’t think I’m ready to explore any relationships yet, but the act of looking and talking to women who might be interested in me is cathartic. About a week ago I started trying to really think about what type of woman I would want a relationship with. Shamefully, my first thought was, “I want to date someone like Becka.”

I should explain. Becka (pseudonym) is my best friend Bill’s (pseudonym) wife. 

Bill and I, along with Larry (you guessed it, pseudonym) have been close friends since high school. Bill is going through a lot. When Bills son was born two years ago, he went into a depressive spiral. He started drinking heavily, taking pills, having suicidal ideations, and (I don’t know this 100%, but I highly suspect) being physically abusive toward Becka. 

One night about two years ago Becka calls me. Bill is drunk/high and going ballistic. I drive straight over, but they live 40 minutes away from me. By the time I get there, Becka has called the police to escort Bill to a detox facility. Well, I don’t want to leave Becka alone so I decide to stick around, play with the baby, and help Becka with a few household chores (at this point Bill is doing nothing to help out around the house). 

Late in the evening, Becka put the baby to bed, then we just stayed up talking. I realized how similar we were and how well we just click. Maybe 20 minutes before I left, we both reached out to grab something at the same time. Our hands brushed and we made a very long eye contact. It wasn’t platonic. If the situation had been different; if I hadn’t been married and this hadn’t been my best friends wife, I know we would have kissed. I realized that night that I had feelings for my best friends wife. 

So I surprised it. We’ve never talked about it, but when ever Bill is on the warpath, Becka calls me for help. Almost every time we see each other, it feels like we have a moment when we share a short stare; like we both know that we can’t act on whatever spark there is between us, but we both want to. 

I realize, by the way, that this might be one-sided and completely in my head, but some recent evidence has made me think there could be more to it. 

In the wake of my upcoming separation, Larry (other bf) and I have been talking a lot. He is recently divorced (aren’t my friends and I good at love?...) and he has been a big help in dealing with my emotions. The other day, after I’d had the thought about wanting to date someone like Becka, Larry made a comment that “when Becka gets the courage to leave Bill” she and I would probably be good together. This was straight out of left field and totally threw me. 

But it gets weirder. This morning my wife calls me. We make some small take about the state of the house (currently getting rid of a bunch of stuff to prep for her leaving) and out of nowhere she says, “I know this may be weird, but I think you and Becka would make a beautiful couple.” We then spoke for about another half an hour where I admitted that I’d had feelings for her for several years. My wife says that I can’t pursue it now(because of Bill), but if the opportunity ever arises I shouldn’t be afraid of pursuing Becka. 

Becka is smart, funny, a fun person to be around, honest, a great mother, stable, and gorgeous. More than any of that, I have cared for her as more than a friend for a long time. I hate the way Bill treats her. Every time he complains about a lack of sex in their relationship, I want to scream “well you’re a sorry sack of shit of a husband. Why should she want to have sex with you!?” 

I should add that Bill went to rehab. Becka believes that he has been clean for 5 months, but I know it’s only been about 2 months. I know he’s trying, but there is a massive wedge in his marriage. I hate to admit this; it makes me feel like an awful person, but a growing part of me wants his marriage to fail. 

I don’t know what to do. I’ve known Bill since I was 15. Despite my current frustrations with his life choices, I love him to death. He, along with Larry, is a brother to me.   

In the past few weeks, Becka has been consistently texting me to check up on me and see how I’m doing. Bills response to my separation was “What the fuck?”, followed by two weeks of nothing. 

I care about Becka and I think she cares for me, but I’m broken hearted because I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to pursue her romantically. 

Love is a strange journey. 

TLDR; my wife and I are separating because she is a lesbian &amp; I think I’m in love with my best friends wife. ",love,1547417112,Bach717,2,1,True,2019-01-13
229,I’m afraid,"I’m a 17 year old guy from Belgium and I have anxiety about falling in love again. I think I am falling in love again but I’m scared of how much pain I will get from it.

A little bit of backstory on how I believe I got this anxiety...

The very first time I ever fell in love I was about 12 years old and I became really good friends with a girl from my class. I kinda knew that she liked me, but I didn’t know how to identify if someone likes/loves you so I was not sure. After a few weeks of us being friends and having a good time I started to develop feelings for her. I don’t know how or why, but suddenly it seemed like she didn’t want me anymore. We were still friends but the love did kinda ruin it all. After we both went to high school I never saw her again, I kept texting her and trying to at least become good friends again but it never worked...

The second time was when I was 15. I wasn’t the most popular guy in class and I could act annoying sometimes. One day I was at a friend of mine’s house and we were saying random shit in the class chat and picking on some guys who kinda picked on me before. After laughing about it we went out and I didn’t check my social media for the entire evening (because I had no WiFi and because I didn’t care to check) but when we came back home I saw I had a message from a girl from my class. It said: “I’m sorry for everyone acting like such assholes to you, don’t mind them just ignore them”. So I checked my class chat room again to see what else they said and apparently she had been defending me and talking back to the class the entire evening. So I texted her back “It’s ok, you didn’t have to defend me like that, but still thank you” and her response was “I just can’t take it when their being like that to you”. At this point I got a hunch that she might be into me or she could just be a very nice girl. So we became friends and basically the same thing happened as last time I thought she liked me but apparently she didn’t and I had feelings for her. After suffering through it for almost an entire year I finally got over her.....



(The next one actually ties in to the last one)
....I changed school and with the last girl still in the very back of my mind, I started my new school year. From the second day in school there was this girl who immediately asked my Snapchat username and started snapping me that day. I again thought I had a hunch that she liked me, but this time I didn’t want to jump into conclusions. But she was into me, people even thought we were in a relationship because of how she acted around me. I liked the attention she gave me and since I felt like this time it was going to work out I let myself fall in love with her as well. But right after I was getting into her she suddenly wanted distance and seemed like she never liked me. I was confused and tried to get her attention again but I never got it back. I accepted that she maybe needed space and would come around so I took my distance, but she started talking bad about me to all her friends (who where also in our class). After this point I told myself I would never fall for a girl again since it only brought me pain....



Later that year around summer time (I was 16 by then) I got a dm from a girl on Instagram saying: “Oops, I’m sorry a friend of mine went on my account liked an old pic of yours, but you’re on bus 287 everyday right?” I knew that it was her stalking me and accidentally liking the pic because I once did a similar thing. So I replied “That’s ok and indeed I am you’re on the same bus, right?” And so we started talking. After a month we went on a date, but I still refused to fall in love, it just seemed wrong to not at least give her a chance. This time it actually worked out pretty well but the thought “I will never fall for a girl again” was ingrained in my mind cause I never fell in love with her even tho she was a nice girl and I tried to be a decent boyfriend. After a few months I got over myself and started to take close steps towards loving her and eventually ended up falling in love. But at the same time I was going trough a rough time and I didn’t have much time to take her out on dates or go to her place to be with her. After a few weeks I asked her when she had time to meet, but she only replied “idk” so I asked if she still wanted to date and she replied: “I wanted to tell you this face to face but I want to take some distance, I’m just not feeling like myself lately and I want to find myself again, hope you understand me”. I felt something was of and felt like I caused it so I replied: “I feel like you’re mad at me, please tell me what’s wrong” and she said: “I’m not mad, I just can’t figure it all out lately” I felt like she was still holding something back but i didn’t want to get into an argument so I simply said: “I still feel like you’re mad, but if you don’t want to talk about it I’ll give you space, text me if you want to talk” she replied “thank you for taking it so well”. I gave it a few days (which felt like months) before taking a leap of faith and asking her if she still loved me and she replied with: “To be honest, not anymore, I’m sorry”. This was about to break me but I kept it together, until I looked at her Instagram that same day and her bio had a heart emoji with the name of another guy. At that point I snapped and texted her furiously. She told me that what we had never felt like a relationship to her and even tho I was furious I understood in a way. I mean she loved a guy who told himself “I’m never gonna fall for a girl again”. Must have been hard. But if I tell my friends how I acted towards her and when I was with her they all tell me I didn’t do anything wrong and she was the problem......

Now I’m 17 and there’s a girl in school who went trough her (now ex) boyfriend cheating on her. I’ve had a few conversations with her and I feel like I kinda understand what she went trough because of the last girl I fell in love with. I also found out we share some of the same interests. I am starting to feel something again, but I just can’t get myself to act on it cause I feel like there’s a big chance she’s not into me and if she is I feel like I’m gonna be a bad boyfriend to her (just like I was for the last girl). On the other hand I feel like if I don’t at least try, I’m letting a beautiful girl and a possibly very beautiful relationship go to nothing.....

I don’t know if anyone here feels the same or knows how I could lose this anxiety but if you do, I beg you for help because if this situation turns out bad again, I think I’m going to end up alone forever and I’m to afraid of that.

233,I’m scared to say I love you,"So I’ve been dating my boyfriend for a little over 5 months. I’ve never been the first one to say it, but it’s constantly on my mind when we’re together. I know he feels deeply for me but I’m just not sure if he’s at the “I love you” stage in his mind. I know I am. I want to say it when we’re cuddling on the couch. When we’re in the car and he kisses my hand before he lets it go. When we’re walking down the street and I look up at him and I’m just filled with love.

I know the mature thing to do is say it and be ok with him not saying it back. And part of me is. But part of me is also terrified. I don’t think it would happen but I’m scared it would change things between us a bit. I don’t want to feel like I’m moving too fast or anything like that.

I’m just looking for some advice on what you guys think about when to say it. Is there a good moment I should wait for? I know I’ve heard it’s not good to say during sex. But what about after? Or before he or I goes home? Maybe do something special like cook dinner and say it? I dunno how to go about it, because I’ve never been the first one to say it, but I really want to say it soon..

234,Advice Crush likes someone else,"Hey, so I started talking to an old friend again, over the months we got closer friends ever than before, and I think I might have fallen for her.

 So today she texted me exitedly, asking for advice for what she could reply to a dude that just started texting her. I helped her out but it made me feel jealous. 

That showed me that she doesnt think about our relationship in that way, or otherwise she wouldn't have talked to me about this. 

So how should I behave? Keep on doing my thing and eventually even asking her out on a date, or maybe back off on that thought to not make things awkward between us in case she actually is not interested?

239,A new character trait created from love,"Back story: In March of last year, I finally left my ex. Together 13 years, married 9. It was a toxic relationship that left me wishing I would just get killed in a car accident or something to end my misery.

I am now in a very healthy, very happy relationship, with a love so intense I know without a doubt that I have found who I was born to be with.

Reasons I cry since 2018:

-Videos about animals reuniting with loved ones
-Fiance's face is too beautiful
-Laughing super hard
-Fiance's reaction to a bad situation was awesome
-videos about deaf people hearing their loved one speak for the first time
-Fiance said something that touched my heart
-My Grandma said something beautiful
-Fiance exists
-Our friends and family blowing up my phone with love and support and helping us out of a financial situation that could have really messed with our future plans to move from a motel to a house 

Up until this point in my life, I did not cry tears of joy that I can recall. I've done a lot of crying, but not for happy reasons. With a mood disorder, severely poor health at times, and struggles throughout my past relationship, my tears were from a place of depression, frustration, and heartbreak. 

Now I cry because... as I now like to say all the time, life is beautiful. 

I always thought women who cried so much for good reasons were kind of funny, and even endearing. Having realized I'm now one of them, I kind of hate it. 😂 I don't like crying in front of people and now the chances of that happening have increased exponentially.",love,1547452081,LetsGoAlreadaayy,0,1,True,2019-01-14

Just to fix you.

The one that makes you happy that no one else could,

The one that you always prayed for, 

The one that loves you honest and wholeheartedly.

244,I cried when I realized that he really loves me back.,"After dinner I was laying in his arms when I looked up at him and felt tears spring to my eyes. I’d never met anyone who makes me feel so safe, cherished, desired, and loved. I could see it all in his eyes, taste it on his lips, and hear it in his whispered words. Last night was a chorus of “I love you” and “I love you too”. He didn’t freak out when I started crying, he just held me tighter, pat my hair, and whispered “I love you” and “it’s okay”. 

I’m so lucky to have such an understanding and thoughtful partner in life. I’d thought I’d known what Love was before but it turns out I didn’t. My past relationships were hopeful of love but it never grew into this indescribable and overwhelming feeling of happiness. I’ve never felt so content and settled in my life. There’s no restlessness in either of our hearts, only the steady assurance that we were made for one another. He is the one who is the other half of my soul. I’ve never met someone so similar to myself, nor has a relationship ever been so effortless. This is as easy as breathing. 

He’s everything I could ever want or need. And he loves me back. 

I’m the luckiest girl in the world. ",love,1547477510,haileythelion,22,1,True,2019-01-14

247,"Moving forward, not letting go","A little bit ago my girlfriend had broken up with me. It was for a number of reasons that had to do with her well being and I totally understand why it had to happen, but I can’t let go of her. I know when someone breaks up with you or vice versa people tell you to move on, let go, but I don’t see it that way. I need to learn to move forward, to push on and not sit in my sadness about it, we’re still best friends, we talk everyday and love one another, I just have to adapt to knowing I can’t be with her all the time anymore. I am a sucker for love, I am that typical cliche and want all the romance, but also pain love brings. She came into my life at a time where I was most vulnerable, but also just needed a little push to understand/become the person I want to be, you don’t just simply let go of something like that. I try and try again, but I can’t get her out of my mind/heart. I don’t know what the future holds for us, but I feel I’d be a damn fool if I let go of the idea anything can ever be again, but I’m also not bagging on the idea that it will either. As much as it hurts and some may say I’m just letting myself suffer by sticking around, there’s so much more depth to our relationship than just being together that pushing her out of my life would just make things worse, I love her as a whole. Together or not I am not going to throw away a relationship I hold so high. Before her, I had “friends” and “relationships”, but I don’t think I really understood what a real friend/relationship was all about, she treated me how I deserved to be treated, told me when I’m wrong, cheered me on when I was right, and encouraged me to keep pushing on, and continues to do so now. I put the link to this song because the beginning reminds me of her beauty and what I adore about her, the middle is where I try to think about “moving on” and “letting go”, then it ends back at the beginning verse. It’s a constant tug of war in my mind, a game of tug of war I never want to end! You can’t feel complete joy without complete sorrow, and this girl, she really showed me that. I love her more than I could ever explain, and I just really needed to vent so thank you.

249,"At the end of each day, no matter what, I love him back. How we each said I love you.","Even the days where I get frustrated that he didn’t follow-through with something I asked him to do, even the days where I’ve been crying or anxious about work, the days I’m hangry and take it out on him, even the days where our communication gets miscommunicated and we get short with one another- I love him. 

I knew I loved my boyfriend about 4-6 months into dating and I am such a scared chickenshit when it comes to verbally expressing my feelings. I remember saying it to him while he was still asleep one morning while I left for work. I texted it to him shortly thereafter and didn’t get a bit response out of it so I backed off from saying it. 

Fast forward a few months and I moved in and learned A LOT about our living habits and what it meant to come home to someone each day. I loved it 99% of the time, the 1% I was angry/stressed/unhappy with other things such as work and I brought that mood home. But no matter what, he always tried to be supportive &amp; give me space, he took some of the grief of the attitude I had but never stooped low to be in a bad mood with me. I loved him even more for that. 

About 3 months into moving in, I started dropping the “l-word” into conversations like “I love you for that” or “Trust me, if you love me, do not go into the bathroom for a bit.”
You know, things like that. 
It was the best passive way of telling him again, “I love you.”

For him- I don’t quite remember how this situation came about but I do remember I was incredibly anxious and upset about something and we were laying in bed one afternoon cuddling. I believe vented to him about I didn’t want to take my issues/anxiety or moods out on him when they came about. He hugged me and said “It doesn’t make me love you any less.” I got a bit of a flutter but didn’t say anything back at the time. 

Fast forward to NYE 2018, we were visiting his family in a southern state and I had been sick most of the trip (stomach bug &amp; a bad sinus infection), I was sick &amp; irritated &amp; lost most of my voice. We had an argument about our NYE plans (us alone vs spending time w/his family) &amp; I started crying because I was sick &amp; tired (literally &amp; figuratively) of the argument. I snapped at him and we ended the conversation at that, he left to go talk with his family and I was alone in our guest house. 
About an hour after the fight, he came back and talked civilly and I explained how the argument felt and the issue in our communication. We both didn’t communicate appropriately and he didn’t try to compromise on our plans when he asked me what I wanted to do. He apologized and acknowledged that he/we need to do better at communicating and talking things out. I started tearing up again and he sat on the bed (at this point I’ve been laid up in bed for about 3 hours sick) and he looked me straight in the eye and said “I love you, hun.”
That made my heart swell and I cried more (happy tears this time).

Today, he still says “love you” most nights before we go to bed, even when after we have a disagreement or bad days at work/with friends/etc.

And no matter how I feel at the time about how the day went, I always love him back. ",love,1547496656,CaMNgirl,0,1,True,2019-01-14
250,It's a long story so STRAP IN!,"I'm 16 and I'm in love with a girl in my theatre group. We go to different schools and rehearsals are only 3 hours every week but I live every second with her. I've been in love with her for about 2 years now but haven't admitted my feelings. And the reason is long and sad (sad for me at least).

About 6 months into my feelings, I was in a French lesson, and it was a Christmas lesson so activities were chill. We were in groups around the table (I can't remember what we were doing but it wasn't productive) when one of the people in my group asked the age old question:

""Who do you like?""

If there is anything I learned from life by that point, it's that don't let young people know who your crush is. 

I refused at first but after constant prodding and me getting hot and bothered because the heating was on in the room and I just burst out admitting both her first and last name. The same guy who asked them shouted it out to the class. The teacher heard him shout but didn't hear what he said. Some people pulled Instagram searches for her name. Luckily they didn't find her.

And then auditions for the next show happened. Me and her got cast as the comedic secondary couple you see in shows. And like in most people who get cast as couples in shows, shipping begins. I could see she didn't agree with the shipping and I played along with her. 

Since then, I kept flirting at a minimum. I didn't and don't want her to get overwhelmed due to the attention of being the greatest couple they could imagine.

I think we're still being shipped but not out loud. Since me and her are cast as Elle and Emmett in Legally Blonde the Musical, and they haven't said anything about it. 

I still want to get closer to her though. Ever since I restricted my flirting, we've become more distant but being cast as romantic leads has brought us closer.

And that is the story of my internal emotional rollercoaster about love. It sounds like a romantic drama that gets like all 4 🌟 reviews and no 5 🌟 reviews.",love,1547497914,elgeejay,2,1,True,2019-01-14

I had just worked a third shift and had a flight the same day at 5 pm to Charlotte. Let me start off by saying that I have never felt this way about any woman that I have just met. I was sitting in the waiting area in front of the gate at the airport, when I saw this beautiful young girl. I am 27, and using my best judgement, I assumed that she was in her early 20's. I was right. I was sitting across from her as I watched her continuously play with her hair out of my peripheral vision. She had no makeup on, yet I thought she was stunning. She was very unique looking, seemingly a mix of white and Spanish descent. I prayed to the heavens above that we would get seated next to each other. (Maybe I was just delirious from not sleeping for over 24 hours.) As I boarded the plane, waddling like a penguin as all passengers do, I realized as I looked up, that my prayers were answered. I was sitting directly next to this beautiful girl. I squeezed into the window seat, and she was sitting in the middle. I apologized for having to get to my seat, only to seem approachable and kind. We didn't really speak until we took off, the whole time I was thinking about what to say for an icebreaker. As was looking out of the window at the sunset over the clouds, she said ""It's beautiful outside."" I said yes it is with a big smile. We had minor casual conversation throughout the plane, learning her name which also turned out to be unique. I learned what she does for a living, and how old she was. We had very little in common, other than humor, age range, and being laid back which can be everything. So why did I fall for this seemingly normal CPA, who is 24 years old, with no makeup on? I wish I could contact her. I know her instagram name, and linkedin information, but it poses the question that I need help answering. WOULD I LOOK LIKE A CREEP?

253,Because of you I can feel alive again ❤️,"LDR; I’m 18 years old and my boyfriend (17) of almost 2 years is the absolute definition of perfection to me, no matter how far apart we are he will always be close to my heart. 

This post goes out to the love of my life, on March 3rd 2017 I fell harder in love with someone than I ever have before. I didn’t think true love was real, after being in a countless amount abusive relationships I forgot what it had felt like to be loved. After trying for so long to find someone I could trust I had given up. But this amazing individual had come into my life and had proven to me that true love is indeed real and that I could trust people again. I met the love of my life online while playing a video game, we talked for hours upon hours a day. We spent every second of every day together doing EVERYTHING we could possibly do just to be close to each other. After talking for awhile he had asked me out, And I happily said yes. Shortly after we had gotten together I made the amazing journey to travel from Michigan, USA to Colorado, USA. It was one of the most amazing, memorable trips of my entire life. I spent a whole week in his arms and I had never felt more alive, we had done so many amazing things together. We went to so many amazing places, I’ve never had so much fun. As my trip came to an end I felt this weight on my heart knowing I would have to say goodbye.. It was the absolute hardest thing to say goodbye to him, I fought back tears the entire drive home. I wanted nothing more but to be back in his arms, seeing his smile, hearing his contagious but adorable laugh. After I had arrived back home in Michigan he had done everything to cheer me up and to make me happy. And he did just that. No surprise because he’s never failed to make me the happiest person alive. But when we weren’t together it felt so wrong to be away from him. I knew from the first conversation we had that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him. I’ve never had so much in common with someone, I honestly can’t think of something we don’t have in common. We love the same games, the same shows, food, cars, just everything. I can’t express how much he has helped me, I struggle with severe anxiety and depression but he has always been there to help me in any way he possibly can. He is my rock, he keeps me stable and he makes me believe I have a reason to live. Without him I would be nothing, I would be lost, empty and broken. I wouldn’t do the things I do today, I’ve grown so much as a human because of him. I am now working to get my GED so I can leave my home state (Michigan) to move down with him (Colorado) this year. I’ve gotten my drivers license and I’ve even gotten a job, Before I had met him I was always anxious and I was so scared to experience real life, I can’t thank him enough for everything he has done for me and everything he has allowed me to feel again. You’re truly such a blessing, you’re such an amazing and kind person. I couldn’t be more lucky to have found the person I will spend the rest of my life with when I’m so young. Love at first sight is very real, thanks to you I know that. I love you very much, and I will do everything I can for you until the day I die. I could never describe in words how happy you make me and how grateful I am to have found you. Everyone on this planet should know just how perfect you are. 

Forever yours, I love you so much ❤️

254,OK im in love," 

Soooo, i have been a shy kid all my life and i am kinda happy that i finally discovered a place where i can express my emotions without the feeling of insecurity. Hello reddit! I want to tell my story (our story). I go to school with this girl and we have met about 3 years ago. At first we didnt like each other that much but time past by and we somehow started messaging each other.

At the begining, it was only about homework or school projects. We didnt connect on any level and i didnt think anything of it. She was like every other person that contacted me before.

A year after that we started talking a lot. We were spending more time in school together and even going out together. She was a very close friend to me at that time and we talked about everything. About our feelings, our grades, our opinions, our solutions to problems and more. I need to say that she is one the popular girls and i started feeling more special because i was she even talked to me. I always thought that i am like every other guy or even below average in every aspect. However, i was feeling so happy being in her company not even realizing that i maybe liked her more than a friend.

I think i fell in love with her about 6 months ago. It was the summer break and we had more time to laugh, talk, fuck around and so on. From one moment, when we went out I just couldnt stop thinking about her. Her beauty, her smile, her beautiful eyes and the way they glow in certain moments, her face, her hair, her perfect body, her intelligence, her persistence. I was in love.

I started being forward to her. I had much deeper conversations with her, talking about passion and love. We started hugging, going on walks or to events together. Things escalated in the last couple of weeks. We were on a few dates (as i call them). She knows i really like her and i have kinda told her what i feel but she hasnt actually reacted to anything. I think she is really scared of commitment but she doesnt know that i would do anything for her.

Today, we are in a weird situtaion. She definetely knows i like her but i think she is too afraid to talk to me about our friendship or relationship. We dont talk the way we used before and i really want to change that.

In these six months i had a lot of opportunities to be with other girls but i passed them because i know i like her more than anything. I want to be me with her and spend time with her. She is all i think about the hole day. I dont even look back when i see a hot girl or flirt with anyone cuz she is the one that i love. I want to be with her more than anything.

wow, it really feels good to get that off my chest and being able to express myself.

Do u guys have any opinions or advice? I would really need one. Thank u for reading this.

Then he rips them again, this time completely so that the whole leg was ripped off.

We then proceeded to have a fight with the pieces of pants we were holding and it was hilarious and we were hysterically laughing while whipping pieces of fabric at each other.

There is this boy. Johnny. He's a friend of mine. Or was. I don’t even know what we actually are anymore. But let’s start by the beginning:

We met because of my best friend Ken. My best friend Ken changed high school so he was in my high school and Johnny was in his class because he changed high school too. So, I started hanging more with Ken again. I don’t know, we were chilling even if we weren’t going on the same school but now we made lunch together and talked in breaks and stuff like that. There was just more of me and Ken. Johnny was with us too because he and Ken liked each other from the first day of school on. They became very soon very close friends and they were so funny together and I don't know... they just matched perfectly. They are at the same stupidity level. Just two stupid kids. I wasn't jealous at all. I swear to everything I have I liked it actually. Because I didn’t want my best friend to be alone in class and just sitting there and waiting to die. Anyway, they never ever excluded me or something. We were chilling all together and I really liked it with them. Because they were so damn funny together and every time I was chilling with them I forgot every stressful thing in my life. They just made my day every day. There were just we three. Almost the whole high school was hating us and talking shit about us. Like I was a fucking whore, Johnny was a fuckboy and Ken just a jerk. They were always waiting for us to do something bad and they turned everything in the worst way impossible just to fuck us up. But we never ever cared about all this stuff. We were just there and laughing about all these dumbasses.

Anyway... the boy. Johnny. You know, this story is all about him so let’s get into him; I never felt something like ""I like him in this way"", “He’s kind of sweet”, “He’s actually hot” or something like this. NEVER EVER. I just liked him as a friend. But to be honest... sometimes it was weird to talk to him about private thing because we didn’t know us very well. Sometimes I thought “What would he be thinking of me when I tell him this?”. So, I always felt something but I couldn't name the feeling. At this moment I didn't think there were real feelings in there but on the other hand I known. I DON'T KNOE HOW TO DESCRIBE THIS FEELING AND KNOWLEDGE AT THIS TIME. But the problem is neither can I today. Anyway, nothing happened. NEVER. A year passed away and never ever happened something.

In this whole year I never felt something when he touched me or looked me into my eyes... Alright, to be honest... sometimes I felt something but that was almost nothing. Just something that was so little that I never paid attention. Sometimes I wanted to be kind of relationship between us two but I don't know... I thought there would never ever be anything. So, I dropped it really quickly. That was really unusual for me because I'm really bad at things like letting go and forgetting...

We always shared everything together. We three told us everything. EVERYTHING (I thought we did that...).

But a few weeks ago, I and the boy started texting and talking about things we weren't telling my best friend.

We talked about going to concerts, festivals and holidays but just the two of us.

One day we started talking about relationships and sex.

We talked about what we always wanted and what we liked.

We figured out that we wanted the same things.

It was quite strange but we just smiled.

Then we started imagining how great it would be if we would start kind of relationship but not a girlfriend and boyfriend thing.

Something like ""friends with benefits"".

And it seemed like we both were waiting for someone of us to ask the other one to start this thing finally.

So, I asked: ""When are you going to ask me if we could do this?""
The boy: ""I'm waiting for you to do it""
Me: ""Do you want to start this kind of relationship with me?""
The boy: ""OF COURSE, WHAT A QUESTION YOU STUPID LITTLE THING""

So, we talked a lot about this.

We never did something, we just talked about what we wanted.

We waited a long time and talked a lot about this thing because we wanted this to work out.

I mean it would've been horrible if it wouldn't work out and then we would hate each other and our whole friendship would fall apart.

In this time, we were mad.

So many times.

He was mad because I didn't touch him or something like that.

But I didn't know what to do.

I was afraid of the moment that all other would figure that out and our best friend would start hating us because we didn't tell him what we were doing.

I don't know, it was really complicated.

But the good thing was that we could talk about everything because we were good friends.

So, these pretty bad stages were quickly gone.

Then the day came: We were out and hanging around together and we were suddenly embarrassed by each other.

It was so strange because we never felt something like this.

We said, ""should we kiss now?"" and things like this OH MY GOD this was so cringing hahaha.

We were freezing, it was so hard to talk and think.

But then he put his hand on my cheek and kissed me.

I swear to everything I have I never felt so much.

It was so good and I really felt comfortable.

Then he suddenly stopped because some people were there.

Was such an embarrassing moment but we laughed and it was a cute moment.

Then we walked for about an hour or two just around and talk as always.

I never felt this close to a boy.

It wasn't a strange moment just because we kissed.

We were relieved because we finally did it.

He really told me what he was feeling.

I was never so happy.

I finally really knew what the other person was thinking and feeling and it felt so clean and real.

I went home and I couldn't stop smiling.

I was so happy.

Never felt better.

I was never ever sure about that someone really liked me.

Unfortunately she is far away from me, but that’s never been an issue or has it ever held us back. I hope that it doesn’t, but if it ever does, I hope she knows I want her to be happy no matter what. But I do hope to meet her some day soon. She came into my life when I most needed her, and we were honestly never meant to even progress as quick as we have been now. 

I can’t help but imagine what our future could be like as a Couple. I’m always thinking about her, and how she makes me feel like the luckiest guy on this planet. I’ve been in past relationships before, but with girls who either do not connect with me or ones who have just gotten bored of me. Every day talking to this girl, I learn more about her wisdom and her strength, and most importantly, I love her that little bit more every single day. 

She makes me laugh, and understands me more than anyone else ever has. She makes me want to strive for more in life, and be the best version of myself. She’s the sweetest girl I’ve ever met, and beautiful. Inside and out. 

I get that we’re young, but that doesn’t scare me. Life with her doesn’t seem as scary, and I hope that one day we get our happy ending. I’m going to ask her to be my girlfriend very soon, because I think it’s the right time even if it feels like it’s gone quick. I just hope it’s not too soon!

286,Yung Love,"Hi, I'm going through a complex feelings right now and I would like some advice

I'm currently 18, and I think I've found the perfect person for me. I've moved to this country exactly 6 years ago, and once I moved to this school this girl helped me out with translating. I was started catching feelings, wrote her letters and everything but she didn't want anything to do with me because we were very young and I was very ugly. About one year later I asked her out in front of everyone and obviously got rejected as I barely used to speak to her. She then went out with my best friend a year later, me and her became really good friends, then best friends. Before they broke up, we had this group in which was 3 boys and 3 girls, we were all trying to get with the other girl. Once they broke up, i was finally just getting somewhere with the girl I was supposed to be doing a thing with. About 6 months later, me and this girl (the one I love)  started talking more romantically. I asked her if she felt anything towards me and she said no so i carried on talking to the other girl (which was her best friend). 10 months later I found out through her diary as we were joking around and opened this page where she just confessed her love to me, and I just felt a wave of feelings towards her, all the old feelings came back. We started dating, lost our virginity to each other and everything so far seem to be going really smoothly. But I started working, and school and a new born sister, things got stressful and I started treating her badly, not physically but emotionally, I was very immature then. After we went on holidays together to America, I came to where I currently live and went on holidays to my home country with my family. She then broke up with me after one year and two months, after we spent our one year anniversary in New York. Well, since then a lot more has happened. I did stupid stuff as fucking one of our mutual friend, many more. But then I realized what I was doing was wrong and it was her who I wanted so we started talking again and we rushed to things, we went back into a relationship a week after we started speaking again. And a week ago we broke up, because she doesn't think her feelings are as strong as they used to be before and that she doesn't think she loves me in a romantically way, but her feelings changes every day and we're constantly arguing. We tried to give each other spaces, but it hurts and eventually we always talk again and it always starts as something romantically then it ends up with something as a friends only. I just would like some advice on what to do because I know I'm young and I know that this might be first love only, but how do I cope with this sadness and stress

My signufucant others (3 so far) always end up just leaving me. Why does it always seem like I'm the only one who truly cares? everytime . After they leave me it's on to the next with them, and it's like they get over me so quickly, like they were never in love with me. And I'm just always alone in the end. Just me sitting down and thinking about someone who doesn't seem to care about me. Idk if I'm crazy or irrational or just fucking stupid. I dont get attached to people easily, it takes time and trust. But when I start to fall in love with somebody I cant fucking stop, I get so involved and so attached man. And I depend on them, especially emotionally. Isn't that what a relationship should be? Shouldn't we both be there for each other and depend on each other for certain things? Should I not be completely open to them? What's the point of being with somebody if I can't be 100% my self and not hold back? 
I dont know why I still have strong feelings for somebody who's doesnt seem to give a shit about me. I know I shouldn't feel this way. And I know I should let go and not give a shit either. But I'm trying and no matter what man, this fucking gloom comes over me whenever I really think about it. When I see them getting closer to another person, not just friendly, and it's been only 2 weeks. Was I just another person to you? You said you loved me but that's not what your actions show. It's a reaccuring thing somehow.
Is it me? Am I doing something wrong ? Is it it me???????

I recently met this wonderful girl who came to my country because a friend of mine has the same nationality as she. We met 2 days, the 2nd time was wonderfull and we talked a lot, it almost felt like she was flirting.
I texted her a good flight home when she went to her home country. Meanwhile she asked my friend to give me greetings from her that she really liked me (idk in what way ahah)
Well we talked a few times in DM but I dont know what to do. I can randomly text her but that would be awkward and I dont know if she even wants to text. I mean i can send her memes but that would be a convo of 3 sentences. And it could be awkward towards my friend if he found out that is said to her that i like her.

305,Love. Huge problem. need help.,"Hello Reddit Community,

&amp;#x200B;

I have a personal question/issue that my friend is dealing with right now. My friend liked a girl and she liked him back. They dated for almost a year.  However, below are some situation/issues/problems/more information about the girl and the guy:

1. The girl has overstayed her visa, her student visa has gotten denied. So, she is now illegal immigrant in U.S.
2. Her Indian parents are overprotective and want her to marry a U.S Citizen for obvious reasons.
3. The girl wants to get her masters done but according to her, being illegal, she cant get education in U.S

About the Guy:

1. The guy is a DACA recipient.
2. He is educated and works for fortune 100 company with enough pay to support her in any way.
3. To make sure, the girl gets legal status, and stays happy he is willing to do anything.

The Problem:

1. Girl's parents (typical Indian) are forcing the girl to break up with the DACA recipient guy to marry a U.S citizen. They beat her, scare her, and torture her to try convince her.
2. The girl kept resisting parents pressure for few months.
3. The guy has offered the girl to come stay with him but she refuses it since her parents are against the guy. also, its against the culture to live with a guy before marriage.
4. The girl starts worrying about her future/ huge amount of family pressure has lead the girl to break up.

Before breaking up, the girl mentioned that if the guy gets permanent legal status, she will come back to him and will go against her parents as long as the guy has legal status.

On the behalf of my friend, I want to know what is the possible solution for this matter?

313,Friend zone? Or feelings?,"So I broke up with a guy just over 2 years ago and it tore me in half. Cut a long story short I haven’t been able to let anyone in.. until now. A friend of a friend that I’ve known for years but has recently come back in my life has quite literally taken over my brain. He’s recently been through a breakup about 4 months ago, however I feel that there has always been some chemistry between us. In the past month we have had very flirtatious conversations, nothing too sexual but not ‘friendsy’ either. We went out with friends, we go drunk, he starts being touchy. Last weekend, we go out with friends again, and he’s all arm around me, tickling my side, kissing my face and holding my hand but secretly whilst we chat to friends, then when we depart, he kisses me on the lips briefly. After that he went a bit quiet - my thoughts were that he had feelings of his ex, I remember the first guy I had sex with post breakup, the emotions I felt were so intense, I guess I felt I’d finally severed all ties. However he’s come back round and he positively comments on my body and my looks, he came over to mine the other day and he was playing with my hair, touching my neck, and poking my face, then called me pretty etc. He’s helped me around the house with some manual labour and picked me up when I’ve needed to get home on a couple of occasions. I sense there is an attraction but I don’t know as he will every now and then say such things as ‘you’re such a good mate’ or he’s not wanting to get involved with anyone whilst he’s getting over his ex, but when he’s in my company, it’s like he can’t not touch me?! 

I don’t understand what this is, has anyone had any experiences like this before? If so, what do you feel the best course of action is? Should I stop seeing him in case he’s messing with my emotions? Or let it play out slowly? He’s the first person I have really felt anything for since my ex and I am convinced he is everything I’ve wanted as a person, yet don’t want to be messed around or worse, risk feeling the crushing hear break again.

316,"Dear Unimportant Person in My Life,","Shoot me. You have come into my life once again.

I hate this. I despise it. 

My thoughts about you are the bain of my existence.

I texted you tonight. You didn't reply. That is always fun to do, isn't it?

I finally admitted to myself that I saw you as a project, like something to be fixed.

I thought that I was doing you a good favor, by giving myself up to you.

I thought that I had the upper hand. That I was the one settling and you were the one that was reaching. 

Those roles soon changed when it turned out that you weren't as desperate as it seemed. And I genuinely began to like you.

You began to manipulate me.

Goodnight,

He let me chase him for years. He was an x gangster with a lot of anger issues. He was entertaining me while with another girl. Things that sat in the back of my mind from the start of each relationship and came full circle.

This is not true love. 

True love is no red flags and no hesitation. It’s jumping feet first without fear. It’s openly talking about your past and feeling no judgements. It’s spending time together doing things that enhance you as an individual and your relationship. True love is pheromones and multiple orgasms. There are so much I have now that I never had in 10 years of relationships. They say when you actually fall in love you realize you’ve never really loved or been loved before. True love erases the pain of not being good enough, emotional and physical abuse, and lastly..cheating.

338,date urself for 30 days challenge,"so i’m personally going through a phase in my relationship where we are separated and need to grow . that is fine . often though , i feel very lonely and feel a void .. like i’m still missing it. after spending months wondering why i was so wrapped into this still , i realized that it is bc i need to learn how to fully love myself again ..

with that said , i decided to manifest a healthier and better love life for myself . although i can come up with an amazing list and attempt to bring it into fruition , my mind blocks everything . this comes back to me learning how to love myself again. 

everyone tells u that u need to love urself first but nobody tells u HOW. now i understand it varies for many people but just a point in a positive direction is all most need . i’ve struggled ( and still continue to) with focusing on myself and giving myself the love i need .

so , for the next 30 days i’m gonna start literally ‘dating’ myself . i will buy myself nice food , get my nails done , and maybe even send loving messages to myself. i i feel like the easiest way to love myself is to treat myself how i would treat my lover. i am a very loving and giving lover so i often put too much into them and not myself . if i imagine myself as that other person , then i could still be over loving and giving and it will be worth it bc it is for myself . i made it my plan to dress up and buy myself a nice steak at a restaurant on my next payday 💜

my challenge (advice) for all of you is to date urself for 30 days . take urself out , spoil urself - treat urself how u would treat a lover . send urself that love that u willingly give to another without reservation. u will find love not only in urself , but u will find ur soulmate . love attracts love .

340,Proof that the USA is not the country of Love,"Getting married after surviving a long distance relationship, we each other promised we would never stay apart.  Call me stupid, or a girl, I cried so much when my wife and I were doing the long distance. I don't want to do it again.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, after working for a few years, my wife wanted to finish the school that she started in the US.  She had to come back to her country without her degree because of the financial crisis (and who caused it?).

Did you know that if you want to study in the US, you almost never can come with your husband /or wife?

The US government almost automatically declines if a couple applies together for a visa. (I wonder why even they allow people to apply that way)

&amp;#x200B;

Even when you have only one semester left to earn your degree, you may never come with your family.

&amp;#x200B;

2,3 years have passed since she got rejected her visa.

She is so proud of her school, but she cries whenever I mention her school or her time in the US.

Remember, she didn't cry when she had to come back due to the financial crisis. She didn't blame the US for that.

She cries after she got rejected the opportunity to finish her degree &amp; be with her husband.

343,I need help getting over a girl.,"I’m a guy [17] from the UK that fell in love with a girl from my class [18] at college. Right now I’ve started my second year of this course. (Bare in mind I’ve been her close friend ever since the start of college)

Around 2 months ago I met with her and told her how I feel. I’ve took my time with asking her out since I’m shy and I wanted to explore her as a person. Unfortunately around 2 weeks before the talk she found a boyfriend. (Which pissed me off since he knew her for like a day, whereas I’ve took my time)

Anyway, long story short I love her with all my heart and want to spend my life with her, but obviously she’s in a relationship.

Ps. Yesterday the 4 of us went out drinking and whilst she was drunk, she kept on talking me how she wants to kiss me and do all of these no PG things with me.

345,"“Lectured” Other Uni Students On What I Think Love Is, Made Me Reflect On My Whole Relationship","It’s the first weekend of the semester, snow is falling down hard outside during the first snowstorm in the Midwest. 
I’m (22f) at a friend’s house with maybe five to seven other people, a small gathering. Majority of them are underclassmen (19 and 20 year olds) though there’s one who’s 23. I’m in a bedroom with three of them, and one’s talking about an ex of hers and mainly missing the regular sex. Off of this conversation, another one asks, “how do you know what love is?”

The freshman girl says “it’s when you want to do non-sex stuff with them.”
The guy who’s a junior, so either 20 or 21, says, “when you share everything together.”

And me, old jaded me who’s coming up on 1 year with my partner since we met, though at this time we’d been bickering all of December, haven’t slept together in near 2 months, and I hadn’t seen him in a week, by choice. This man who I used to go out of my way to see every. single. day.
He’s also working hard on his thesis, so we don’t even text much either. 

I say, “it’s when shit gets hard.” No one responds so I add, “it’s when the commitment becomes work, when you have to be deliberate in what you do, and you have to make a choice to stay even when things aren’t ideal.”

Now I’m not saying the background I come from is normal by any means, and if people comment I wouldn’t be surprised if they advise me to break up with him. Maybe we will some day, I don’t know. I also like to think I’m the great wise one in this scenario but that’s not true, I’ve lived very little.
But suddenly I felt so old, like I was talking to 18 year old me in that room. It was surreal. And I may read this post 3 months from now and my current relationship may be dead and buried, but I’m grateful for being a part of it. ",love,1547910506,rococosevelt,1,1,True,2019-01-19

Okay so lately I’ve been having very real feeling dreams that involved my male best friend. 

At first when I would dream about him it just felt like when someone randomly pops up in your dream and you’re just like “oh okay” but now I have these dreams when I think about it I cry not because I’m sad but because the feeling I get when I have these dreams are overwhelming.  I look forward to going to sleep,  because most of the time I dream about him and it’s the reality I want. 

One I had last night in particular- I was laying beside him in a dark room and I was cuddled up next to him looking up at him. I remember him taking my hand and saying “there is so much about you to love” and kissed my hand 

I don’t remember saying anything but I remember the feeling I had when he said it. It was so real. 

I keep thinking about it but I don’t want my dreams to cloud my reality like I find they do sometimes like you ever think “did this happen in a dream, or did this really happen” because I find that happens with me a lot

356,Love,"There’s a couple ways that the romantic type of love can work. Love can mean that you love someone with everything you have. Every single bit of your heart and soul goes into being so infatuated and so admiring of that one person occupying your mind and getting nothing in return. The unreciprocated type of love. There’s the sexual love. The type where you don’t love the person, but you love the way they make you feel and how they can send you off into the stars on a rocket of pleasure. Then, there’s the type of beautiful, mind blowing love. The type of love where you’d spend weeks in freezing rain, walk through the hottest of deserts, and swim the roughest of seas to be with that person that you spend all day thinking of. The kind where if you couldn’t get to them, you’d wait it out or find a way. The kind that consumes you and your body and every last bit of your mind and you know that they love you too. You love each other so much that you can see every last minute of your life together and even if you can’t, you know it’s there and you’ll figure it out. When you could lay in bed with them for hours upon hours, just killing time and being with each other. When you listen and care and are willing to give everything for this person.

A couple weeks ago, I found that last type of love. On the 27th of December. I met this boy on Reddit. (Thank you Reddit, all the love to you as well.) He’s so absolutely perfect. He makes my heart beat every second of every day. The only problem is he lives far. But is that really a problem? Is it a problem that we’re young and we just met? Is it a problem that the only thing in our future that’s clear is each other? I don’t think so. I can tell him anything. I’ve been through quite the hard time these past couple weeks and he’s helped me so much. If it wasn’t for him, I don’t know what I’d be doing. Such a sweet, loving soul. If you’re reading this, I want you to know that every ounce of the love I feel for you is pure and real and always there and even if our stars don’t align perfectly in the end as they do now, I want everything for you. I can’t wait to meet you and hold you and tell you all of this in person, my sweet. I can’t wait for our next step. I love you so much.",love,1547953801,noodlefedstudent,1,1,True,2019-01-19

361,Who knew love could be so painful,"I’ve written 8 poems about her. Her hair is an astonishing bronze color, her eyes are deep pools of water with every color imaginable, her skin shines in the light, and her smile forced me to smile too. She has the perfect body, and she dances like a queen. I’m only 15, but I’ve fallen in LOVE and she kills me softly every damn day. She gives me about 4 hugs a day, but each one feels like a shot in the chest, because I know she thinks of me as a friend. She is the most beautiful, sexiest, most special girl I’ve ever met. I pray to God everyday thanking him for the blessing and also asking that one day, she might love me back. It may not be this day, but one day. But oh what a fool I’ve been. I’ll always be the friend. She also confessed today that she lost her virginity to her ex who was a total dick. I asked her if she regretted it and she said no. I thought that we could have our first kiss together or lose our virginity, but some lucky punk ass fucking prick stole it away. I went into the bathroom, laid my head against the mirror and just breathed and asked God why he enjoyed torturing me. Asking why he sent an angel, to toy with my heart. I went back to the party and put on a smile. We started to sing love songs. She couldn’t tell but when I was singing I was looking at her and only her. I guess that’s what makes me want to cry. I think about her day and night, barely getting sleep, but she will never know, because I know she loves me in only a best friend way. And God knows I’d take a bullet for her. With my luck, some other asshole will seduce her and have a good time, while I remain the funny guy who makes everyone happy. It ain’t like the fucking movies.

364,Is this the friendzone?,"I had a girl recognize me when I worked at subway, turns out her and a few of her friends remembered me from when I dated one of their friends a few years prior. We talked for a while and eventually I got her snapchat and we talked every now and then. I would make up reasons to see her at work, even if it meant eating Papa Murphys three nights in a row.

She mentions to me that her current job was no good and asked if I could help her get a job at subway so initially I thought a pretty girl talking to me like this is just trying to get something out of it. A few weeks later shes hired and I'm the one training her, and we hit it off like crazy, we talked every night, we worked together flawlessly, everything seemed perfect, her body language always showed interest, she would talk to her mom about how amazing I was, how important she feels with me, we opened up to each other on a whole other level, and I haven't felt this way since my last serious relationship. Every now and then shed call me out of nowhere, wed talk for hours on end, sometimes we would video chat and one night after she had a few drinks it was quiet and just a call to have the company of each other.

Although I would ask her to hang out and see a movie outside of things and I never got a clear answer, most times it was because of strict parenting which is understandable. But when it came to other friends it was never a problem, we did hang out a couple times and we had a lot of fun, but it didnt last long because by that time school came around again and she was forced to quit by her parents, she cried the last day we worked together and I couldn't bear the thought of not seeing her everyday. This girl was my motivation for everything. I told her how I felt about her and she told me she didnt want a relationship, she never said she doesnt feel the same way. She only pointed out the fact that she doesnt want a relationship and that she feels we arent compatible, which kills me to think about because we are quite similar. She made me a playlist of music we both liked to listen to at work, we like the same food, same movies, same sports, I had never actually fallen for someone so deeply.

Unfortunately because we no longer worked together we slowly stopped talking due to the slight awkwardness it brought about, she is busy with school and sports, meanwhile I work full time 30+ miles away, I haven't seen her since the last day we worked together but we still keep in contact every now and then, recently she has messaged me explaining how much she misses me, and how much she misses working with me compared to her job now. I have not gone a day without thinking about how much I miss this girl but it seems like there is nowhere left to turn, I just wish I had played things differently, I did so much to bring her up when she was down and all it has done is bring me down now that it's gone. I have fallen into this love pit that I can no longer get out of and all I can think about is the fact that not only did she show her interest through her actions, but she came back and bit me with the friendzone, am I just crazy?..",love,1547981177,Zayuhhh,0,1,True,2019-01-20

366,Anxiety problems / How do I keep myself from overthinking things in romantic relationships / Is it love?,"This is a cross post from r/relationship_advice Thought I might get some answers here as well.

TL; DR down below.

I (m29) got to know Mary (f26) through university. We hit it off pretty quickly, share several classes and projects, spent some time together and are very much on the same wave length e.g. when it comes to humour, beliefs or just basic topics. We've been knowing each other for about 4 months now.

When we met Mary was in an 8 year lasting relationship she in my eyes should have ended sooner because of her ex being rather needy and using her. You could say she didn't mind it that much since she's the oldest of four and took care of her siblings since she was able to, to support her parents. It was just one more person to take care of.

I on the other hand was stuck in an half assed exclusive affair/romance that lasted for the past 1,5 years with my coworker Jane (f27). Said coworker is a whole other story with lots of ups and downs. It is fair to say, that I might not be over this, though I think I know that it has no future. I sort of had to force myself out of it and not keep trying over and over again. I ended things with her to give Mary a chance.

So here I am. We're kinda dating now, taking it slow. She left her boyfriend over Christmas, but for her own sake and not only for me, but because she realized that it is her life and she experienced a certain freedom for the first time in her life due to moving to a new city to study here, just as myself. When we're in public we're staying under the radar, but everybody knows what's up more or less because we hang out a lot.

She caught my attention early on, but it wasn't birds and butterflies all over the place. Now I'm finding myself in old shoes, wondering what's going to happen, if it will work out or not. I don't want to harm her, Can I trust certain feelings? Is it real? It still can go either way, nothing is set in stone and this is not about marrying her right away, but I'm getting very anxious from time to time Thinking about making a mistake by chosing her as my girl friend. I've fallen in love before and know how it feels to like someone head over heels right from the start, this is not the case with her.

I learned that there are different kinds of love, which develop or exist differently. I'm wondering if I'm not allowing myself to be happy, to be enough for another person. I used to have rather heavy self esteem issues, my parents divorced when I was in my early 20's. I also need my space from time to time (bit of a hiermit) but have problems recognizing this and stating that need at the right time.

One of the biggest issues I have is that I still find other women attractive (and always will). In my mind this is proof that I'm still looking for something, somebody else, something better. I'm giving me a hard time for looking after other women, feeling guilty about it even though I'm not even in a relationship yet (I see to have high moral standards). I can't even think of dating two or more people side by side.

TL; DR: Met someone, now dating. Questioning everything, doubting my own feelings. Am I sabotaging myself or not allowing to be loved/liked?

My question is: I like her. Is this good enough for now?

Thank you.

Edit : Maybe I should mention, that she is likes me quite a bit and I think she'd like to see me as her future Boy friend, which puts some pressure on me I feel.",love,1547990173,redditor2802,2,1,True,2019-01-20

375,"I need help, I think I can´t fall in love","First of all, sorry for my English, it isn't my first language. I'm 18 years old and I think I am unable to love or, at least, love someone who loves me back. I've been researching this problem for a while now but I haven't seen anything similar to this. Even though I'm still young, I've dated some people (boys and girls) but all of my relationships always end up the same way. At first, I get a crush, and it goes on as normal until that person likes me back. I could have the biggest crush ever on that person, that, the moment we kiss or we start dating, I get ""repulsed"" by them. By this, I mean that I start to hate the attention that they give me: kisses, hugs, smiles... And I feel so bad because of this because I feel like a bad person like I should be happy because they love me. 

The first person I've ever been with was my first kiss. And that kiss felt amazing, but as soon as it happened, I only wanted the relationship to end. I thought that maybe, I didn't like him so we broke up. It wasn't a relationship per se, it lasted less than a month. 

The next person I dated, was a girl because I was exploring my sexuality and I thought that maybe I just liked women. Well, this relationship was, in my opinion, the best of all I had, but I think that it was because I couldn't see her really often. But in the end, I ended up wanting to leave the relationship the next week we got together, having the same feelings I had before. When she broke up with me, it was really hard for me to forget her, but it didn't make any sense how I was feeling repulsed by her affection and the moment she left, I just wanted her again. 

The third person I had something with was my best friend. I really tried to be sure about my feelings, and I swear I thought I liked her so so much. And no, it wasn't friendship. So when she said she liked me back, I even cried of relief. This feeling just lasted two dates. We split because I told her my problem and we agreed that it was for the best.

After all of this, I stopped having crushes (I am not someone who falls quickly for someone, but this was a really long period for me to not like anyone at all). This year though, I started university and I met this really nice guy. We started hanging out every morning to catch together the subway to go to class and ended up hanging out outside of uni too. I started catching feelings two months after a great friendship, but it was hard for me to admit it because he isn't really my type I guess and I saw him as a friend. But I started noticing that my ""crush"" for him was much bigger than any other I had. So long story short, we spoke about our feelings and started a relationship. But this stupid feeling I get every time  is back and I just want to leave him. I like him I really do, but I want to leave and I don't like when he touches me or looks at me lovingly or anything. I feel like a jerk for this. He treats me sooooooo good but I can't I feel awful. Will I ever be capable of love?

376,Big Mistake,"Have you ever wanted to apologize to someone so badly, but you can’t seem to find get a hold of them or find the best time to do so? 

This is my dilemma. One night I did something very untasteful in front of another man who I had previously been involved with. We were never exclusive, but we were in touch that night. As the night progressed, with him in mind, I actually ended up kissing another man that night. I remember turning around at some point and I saw him. We locked eyes. I saw the face of the man that I truly cared for and had no intention in leading on and worse, hurting. 

Was I drunk? Yes, but I know what I did and why I did it. Do I think I have a valid excuse for hurting someone unintentionally? No. 

As I sit here writing this, I wonder, after a month since this happened, why am I still trying to find a way to apologize. What do I want? I should’ve done it then so why am I still hung up on this?

Here’s the truth, we spent one night together, but that was not the first time I met him. We had met before and I remember having a wonderful time with him every time we saw each other. I got to know this person and liked what I saw. I developed a soft spot for this wonderful human being.

Here’s the problem, we work at the same company. I knew that this could not go anywhere because  we are two people who care about our careers. Realistically, there can’t be anything serious between us so I accepted that. After our one night stand, we carried on and didn’t see or contact each other.

A couple months later, I saw him again, I was very happy. We kept it cordial just as two adults in the workplace should. However, he reached out via text later that night and we kept texting, but I had no intention on going home with him. I didn’t know how to express that as much as I wanted to spend the night with him I couldn’t because I was scared to continue a FWB relationship when I knew deep inside I wanted more. 

I will never forget the look he gave me. I feel guilty. I still do. I can’t be sure if I hurt him, but that is half the reason why I am writing about this because I still care about him. 

And then there’s me. I want to redeem myself. I don’t want him to think of me as some whore at work.

382,Please help me.,"Okay , so first of all sorry for my bad english. It is my 2nd/3rd language.

( this will be a loong post, sorry)

So yeah , my problems go back to 2016, I became  depressed because I stayed up until like 5am everyday to make my girlfriend ( back then) stay alive. I was completely hooked on her, I probably could've killed someone for her, but she didn't feel half of what I felt, so that has made me think that i'm not good enough for anyone. In january of 2017, I hadde gone completely mad. I was always thinking about suicide, how I wasn't going to accomplish anything in my lite and how nobody was going to ever love me for who I am.

Luckily, in the end of january, I met a girl, we hung out, and well yeah, lets just say I quickly lost feelings for the  other girl. The problem however, was that my new girlfriend also had some problems on her own. Her problems meant that I had to be very careful with what I said and did, this made me extremely quiet (not good), and then made me stop hanging out with friends.

I am a very social person, so I need to be around people 24/7, just to keep myself sane. So yeah, my relationship made me both happy and very stressed (because of my social life being killed). 

After about 4,5 months, I broke up with her. The very same day , I got asked by a girl who used to bully my ex , If I wanted to have sex with her. And well as stupid as I was, said yes. (We became together before doing it, and my ex knew) 

I had sex with her, but instantly regretted it, so did she. We both decided not to talk about it ever again, and then ofcourse broke up.

After about 1 month, I got back with my ex, and we were happier than ever. But the problem was that because of her mentalstate, I (as stupid as I was) decided to say that I didn't have sex with the other girl. (Huuge mistake)

We were pretty okay for about 10months, but then shit went downhill when I went to Colombia. While I was there,she was at a schooltrip , and then the other girl had said that we had sex (because of truth or dare). She was not happy.. 

She said she was thinking of breaking up, but ended up not doing it. I told her I was going to be the best boyfriend ever when I came home. 

While I was in Colombia for those 3 weeks, she was sending me pictures of her hanging out with her (male) friends, looking waay happier than she used to ever be with me. Not to mention that one of them was two years older and was the one to take her virginity.
So I was completely heart broken , because I knew that I had lost her, without being able to do anything about it.

About a week after returning home and I was about to go to Spain for another 3 weeks, she broke up with me.
I was really confused about how I felt about it. I had gotten freedom,that I didn't really want.

After about a week I started to feel really lonely, so then I tried to get to know our mutual friends(girls) better. Didn't go quite as good as I had hoped.
 
Lets speed up things here,getting bored by writing at 2:25am.

But yeah I felt lonelyer for everyday, and it made me crazy. I tried to flirt with a friend of my ex, but I ended up getting humiliated by my ex.

Now it has gotten better, but I have problems.
I feel lonely when i'm not hanging out with anyone, but now I am talking with the prettiest girl I know and have ever known,and we have kissed and cuddled. When I'm with her, I am the happiest boy ever, I have never been happier. The only issue is that I don't feel like I deserve her. I also don' t feel like she would ever date a guy like her and that if so I would just dissapoint her.

I am completely head over heels for this girl, and she seems interested, eventhough she says she doesn't like anyone like that at the moment. Eventhough she says that she doesn't have those kinds of feelings for anyone, it really feels like she does.. When we hang out we seem like a couple.. We kiss, hold hands and hug. 
I don't really know what to do , or what the point of this post was.. 

I just really don't know what to do.
She is literally perfect for me and she makes me suuper happy. We share the same humor, food taste and tv shows! Only problem she has is that she prefers pepsi over coke.. But we agree on all other beverages:p

Tldr:
I have some mental problems that causes me to overthink stuff, but I have now met the perfect girl.

I thought this guy would be in my life for so long but things changed so abrupt and now he’s gone. He was always the one to lift me up. He would joke around saying that I was the kind of girl he would marry, he would brag about my to other people. We never even dated but he put a smile on my face. I would always push him away though because my over thinking led me to think that he would never like me, let alone spend time with me. 
A few days ago he came in to see some friends and hugged me telling me that he loved me and was going to miss me and suddenly I got all emotional. Because we don’t talk any more and I just know that the last time I saw him that was probably going to be the last time we see each other.

Find such magnificence hidden in this

Dreg heap cage of wretched people bound by lex

Crisp elevated air, the thrill of prospect,

And a dash of nerve bound to potential

To the tantalizing question which seems

To slip my grasp as fast as I can speak

385,Different perspectives of love,"My girlfriend and I had a conversation earlier today in which we discussed our different perspectives on what love it. 

I've always seen it as a commitment. A promise that you will care for and worry about that person forever. Love is a responsibility, and you're willing to do it for the person that makes you happy. They make you feel safe and comfortable so you love them by being there for them. You feel good around them, so you love them. 

Whereas she sees it as a feeling. A feeling that you are able to be open and honest with a person without judgement. A feeling of total safety and comfort. And because of that feeling you do your best to care about that person. You love them, so you feel good around them. 

Curious to see what other people think about our interpretations of love, or if anyone else has their own interpretation. ",love,1548049220,MajMin5,2,1,True,2019-01-21

395,Does she like me back?,"I don't know if this is off-topic but I guess it's kinda related to r/love. So, I wanted to talk a bit about my crush on my best friend ( I am 15M). So it all started when I met her in September 2018 (she is in my classes), I got to know her quite a lot and we became best friends ( she also thinks of me as her best friend), but over time I realized I have a crush on her. What I've noticed tho is that during class when I often glance at her, she is looking at me too and we just keep eye contact for like 3 seconds, while she is smiling. We became especially close throughout December, started to talk and chat a lot and we generally hung out together with other friends. But one time we were 5 people and the other 3 had to go, so we remained just the two of us for an hour. She complained to me for a lot of things( f.e. how the other boys were annoying her, what she thinks about some other girls) and she told me that the reason she was constantly glancing at me during class is that I was ''cute''. I was surprised but didn't really come with a reply, it was just an ""ok''. So the convo carried on while we were walking to the bus stop (she lives in the suburb), I was just throwing some stupid jokes and she was laughing a lot. Finally when we reached the bus stop and the bus came, she gave me a hug, it felt so magical, but when I went home I just suppressed my feelings and told to myself that it was a ''best friend hug''. But then I realized I was the only boy, who she has hugged with will and not just being forced to( f.e. those annoying boys I was talking about earlier are the jerks who just go to her and tell her '' yo gimme a hug''. But for me, she literally dived in without hesitation. We went out one more time this time with more friends and again she gave me that slow hug in front of our friends. In the following days we were texting and etc. (that was around the end of December 2018). 

Alright, so fast forward to New Year's Eve. It was 00:01, first thing I did was pull out my phone and text her ''Happy New Year I love you &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3''( this wasn't a confession), she replied with the same followed by a couple of ''how ya doin'' questions etc. I am pretty sure those hearts were just friends hearts. So 2 days later we were at school again, I noticed she wasn't looking at me at all and was kinda avoiding me. I decided to text her and asked her if she wants to go the cinema- she responded with a quick ''I can't, I have to study and got volleyball later that day''. Now I understand that she is really hard working and when she is focused on some kind of work she doesn't think about anything else at all. But I asked her the same question 1 week later and she again said she was ''busy''. Now it's 22nd January and last time I texted her was 2 weeks ago ( we don't have school atm) I am kinda scared to text her, cause I think she found out that I like her and creeped out. Or does she think that I rejected her by not responding much to those hugs and the ''you are cute'' thing? I am confused and don't know what to do. Help!

400,"cheesy love story, I’m sorry. I just really adore the fact that I met my person","I’ve had some type of dating site for five (5) years. I went on over 20+ dates. I only had a second date once, and after I thought everything went so well, he told me he was no longer interested. 

I didn’t feel comfortable going on any other dates after that. I was sure that I was destined to be alone (I’m only 22, so yeah, that was naive). 

I was tired of men. I’d been on dates where the men had insulted my work, my appearance, I experienced a sexual assault on one, and I was just genuinely downtrodden. So I vowed that I’d stop looking.

I deleted all of my dating apps, cleared my mind, and started focusing more on myself and my work/schooling.

And then, right as I’d given up, my coworker asked me on a date and we hit it off right away. He was into all of the same hobbies but had hobbies of his own as well. Our political opinions were similar, our upbringings were both full of surprises, and everything was just... comfortable. 

Fast forward to the end of the first date—we walked into my apartment and he immediately saw my empty IKEA furniture boxes that I had yet to put together. 

“Do you want some help with these?”

I never believed in any sort of love before that moment. But now I had a man in front of me that was seriously offering to help me tackle the Mount Everest of furniture assembly.

That was the moment I knew I loved him. 

And every moment since has been absolutely perfect. He’s kind, genuine, hardworking, funny, passionate, and so goddamn incredible.

In three months, I went from having a coworker I adored to having a partner that I love.

Next time I showed up and she went out of her way to say hello so I talked to her about stuff etc but she said she had overprotective parents and wasn't able to give out her phone number. That's the last I heard from her unfortunately and I spent a few months driving back and forth to the rink to do my lessons and then stay afterwards hoping I'd see her again, but she never showed up. I started asking people and found out her last name and one of my friends got mistaken with who I was talking about and told me the Instagram page of the girl who I thought was the one I was searching for, but due to the name and username of the page, I realized wasn't the right one, but my friend said this now mystery girl liked me so I kept her in mind. I gave up driving back and forth and then one of the mystery girl's friends followed me, which I didn't know. Then later the mystery girl who would become my girlfriend of 8 months follows me and I'm remembering the rumor that this person has something for me. I didn't know how to start a conversation so I waited a bit and then on her story she posted something from her tellonym that said ""crush crush"" which ended up being some random guy and on the next page she went on about how she was single and that she ""will lure you out with cat pictures and memes"" so I took my opportunity to start a conversation with ""you're not the only one with cat pictures and memes"" and I sent a cat in a sock and a random meme from my camera roll.

I know  I’m not that important to her at this time and it hurts, but I know in  my heart that at some point in her life, even for a second, I was  important to her, maybe the most important. It was beautiful, what we  had. I hope she got the day she dreamed about, and that she will have  all the happiness in the world. This would make my pain worth it.

We don’t enjoy doing anything together anymore. You don’t want to go to the bar with me. I don’t want to go to concerts and shows with you. Every time we go out it’s a fight. Every party ends with us drunkenly arguing. If we can’t do anything we enjoy together then what’s the point.

When we went out in Chicago it ended with you leaving to go sit down in the back leaving me feeling lonely and like an idiot not knowing where my own girlfriend was. When my dad asked how your night was and you told him you hated it I’ve never been so embarrassed. I wanted to go to those shows hoping to see you try to enjoy yourself, for us to try to enjoy each other, but the furthest thing from that happened.

When you told me you were buying tickets to asia for 3 months I was hurt. There was never any thinking about doing it conversation. There was never any would there be a way for you to come conversation. You never asked how I felt about it or what I thought about it; you told me it so matter of fact-ly that I couldn’t believe it.

On Sunday I was hoping something would magical would happen. I was hoping we would have the perfect night going out and cuddling on the beach. Instead we argued and you wouldn’t talk to me the rest of the night, leaving me crying to myself.

I don’t look forward to hanging out with you anymore. I don’t enjoy drinking with you anymore. I’m not happy.

434,Is he in love?,"Hay! {This can contain a lot of bad writing lol sorrey guys x}

 So there's this guy T and girl me (J). So a coule of months ago (August) he wanted to meet with me but i didn't wanted to, his friend B knows where I live and he told T. I was showering and then couple minutes later he sends me a message and said that he is in front of my house (lol pretty creepy IK, I'm glad that he didn't break in or sum). They (T and B) were just standing there in front of my house and kept calling me, i just ignored them. Then maybe 20 minutes later i went outside to meet them and they were kinde disappointed but also happy that i came, so we had a short chat. Before they left, they gave me sum kinda bracelet.

Then when school started again in September we saw everyday in the bus, we made a lot of eyecontact. 

But today he made eye contact again and he waved at me, maybe i just mislooked it but I'm not sure tho. My eyes see good and i know that he waved at me.

So what should i do right now?",love,1548271788,jukiel19,1,1,True,2019-01-23
435,for Matthew,"Today was good. I woke up next to Meg and she’s such a cuddler when she sleeps. She takes up a lot of the bed for such a little dog but she always moves herself so she’s stretched out along my back as I move throughout night, and I think that’s nice. She also doesn’t pester me to go outside in the morning and I appreciate that about her. 

After, I went to Damon’s to watch football. I’ve always enjoyed watching football with him. His understanding of the game has helped me learn a lot. We ordered Chinese food and talked about next season and who we need in the draft. 
But always, you’re on the back of my mind. 

I found myself having a conversation with you in my head. I hear you say “Patrick Ma-hall-of-fame” and it makes me smile.  I see that I type out “hashtag” in a message to Jeremy and I realize that he won’t understand the nuance of it. The inside joke of it. 

At the end of my long, full day, here I still am, thinking about you. 

I’m unsure what to do. I want to reach out to you but I’m afraid. I tell myself that you don’t want to hear from me. 

I think about how in March we’d have been talking for a year. And we talked a lot. I wonder if you miss it. I wonder if you’re better off without me like you thought you’d be. ",love,1548283091,bwood605,3,1,True,2019-01-23

444,appreciate each other,"Scold me the internet. Because of my obsession with work and my music, I lost my girlfriend. 

At first I thought “yes, okay, F\*ck it” but my heart certainly didn’t give me peace of mind, because “F\*ck it” didn’t work.Therefore, I went to look at how ""love was dying"" in her records in the social network. Well, you know all these songs about the fact that “it's all over” and “bla-bla-bla” which I discovered of course. It hurt terribly, But this is my fault so it deserved. Then I suddenly saw that she has a separate album with my name, I thought there would be something like ""die you \*\*\*"" or songs that we associate with something, but ... There was a separate album with all my songs what I threw at her, dudes! With all the most up-to-the-minute demos recorded on the pimp of an all-wheel-drive homeless, in short, EVERYTHING in general! I sit now and think about the price I was given this lesson.

 In short, guys, girls, love each other, appreciate every minute that you spend together and enjoy it. Pay attention to all sorts of small amenities that your loved ones do in secret from you, because they do not do it for a tick, but just like that. Because they love you.

446,To LOVE is to GAMBLE," Gambling has different forms, such as poker, slot machine, mahjong etc. 

 It requires patience, timing, skills, luck, money and faith to gamble, thus odds are always at stake. 

 These odds would either lead you to the victory that you sought, or defeat that which most of us fear of.  Each move we make determine the odds, the greater the odds the better, But every move is a choice, a choice that would take a huge risk to win or lose, if it's worth the shot risk it, if not then don't.  

They say ""To love is to gamble"", somehow gambling and love has a lot in common. 

 The thing about love and gambling that scares the most of us is losing, when it comes to the possibility of winning we look forward to it, the greater the reward is worth the risk.   

I, myself is a gambler both life and love, odds would always change, but my love, faith, and patience to you would still remain unchange. 

 I took the risk because i knew that you are worth something greater than any reward i might get,no matter how long it takes, it's not just an idea, it's a choice and responsibility i decided just for you. ",love,1548320124,janc2324,2,1,True,2019-01-24

452,Hi There,"Begin rant:
God I hope you're reading this. All I can think about, is a tomorrow where we are together, where we can just talk about all the ridiculousness the past while has been. There's a few things that still make me feel doubt, I can't help but see the level of deception here. I hope above all else, you walk me through this web of lies, that what I saw was meant to be. I want to believe you are my destiny, that ever since I thought I figured it out, something bigger than both of us has been trying so hard to push me to you, I just have to be ready in your eyes.

Maybe I am crazy, I made everything up, and everything is how it appears to be. I want you to know that I'd be ok with that. I've been ok with it this whole time. I value your happiness and health above anything else. I just wish we could sit down and talk about everything, because the way it all seems right now, looking at the whole, so much seems... Wrong.

If I am right, and what I want is what you want, it's difficult for me to specify what the first step is. Though the past has shown you're incapable of hurting me, to immediately get over everything may be a lot.

At the end of the day, you're still an exceptional (/ly frustrating) person, perhaps 'on the next level'. For a while that was my down fall, thinking your so exceptional I was unworthy.  There's no other person alive who can do what you do, and get away with it. You're beautiful and I hope we meet at church. Have a good day copy cat.

461,Falling out of love?,"(Long-ish) bear with the formatting - I’m on mobile. 

I’ve been dating the same guy for two years, we knew each other for four years prior to dating and have been living together almost just as long. Now hear me out, I understand that no one is perfect, but a part of a relationship is communicating fairly effectively most of the time. A few things that are big for me would be overall respect, kindness, pitching in and, holding to your word. 

We split just about everything down the middle so it’s fair, plus it’s not as much strain on either of us, allowing for a little leeway in our own wallets.

What is not equal is what is done in and around the house. We both work full time jobs. On days that I work and on my weekend I have to maintain my home. I own it, I take pride in it, I’m not a slob. I thought we had established picking up after yourself and helping with simple things like dishes, vacuuming, etc; at one point he just stopped. He’s tired after work so it usually won’t happen and he does whatever he wants on his days off - so obviously it’s not going to happen. 

I’ve tried in every way I can think of to ask/ talk to him about it and it seems like if it just isn’t his cup of tea he won’t effing do it: like cleaning the effing mess you’ve made, in general helping around the house, then things based on a moral standpoint. If I don’t ask (often more than two or three times) it isn’t going to happen. He told me to just write stuff down and it would happen.. so a few little things get done. I’m very tidy and to have to consistently clean up after a mess I haven’t made stresses me out in my own home - this point doesn’t seem to make him care. 

I get responses that are to the effect of “well how do you know it’s me that’s making the mess?” It’s incredibly irritating. I lived alone for several years, I know I’m not messy. Mind you there’s been a lot of leeway in my own standards just out of trying to be nice, but I feel like a fucking doormat at this point. 

The big kicker is that he has this friend, he and his wife talked about having another baby and began trying. She gets pregnant, he slaps her with wanting a divorce. It spins out much worse from there. At that point I told him I don’t feel comfortable with someone like that in my home. Today I come home from work, guess who is in my house. At no point has my opinion changed, we never discussed anything more, he never said anything to me at all except ok. 

He’s terrible with timing (though he’s been trying) he’ll give me a time frame, mind you we’ve also planned to do things on these days, and then just not uphold to it which keeps me waiting for hours. I’m so discouraged at this point. I feel awful because I see that he tries, I also wonder if it’s just half asses effort to keep me around. 

The real kicker - and something I haven’t gotten over, which is probably a huge part of what fuels this, is that we were discussing getting married about a year ago. Things weren’t the way they are now or as bad. He pressed me to go look at rings with him. I go. He learns what style I like. He never gets one. Instead he’s purchased a new motorcycle and other things for himself. After pressing him for why he told me he didn’t think we were ready yet. That’s fine, if maybe he talked to me about it instead of letting it slid to the wayside like I would just move on too. 

The person that says they love me and yadda yadda yadda doesn’t actually hear me out on things that are important to me, I’m stressed out in my own home and throughout daily life half of the time. I feel like I really don’t love him, or am starting not to.

463,We're a team.,"It took me a silly amount of time to understand this. I would compete and try to be the best. I would do my utmost to show him that i loved him but i made our relationship feel competative and as a result i made him feel like he wasn't doing enough. Neither of us are perfect and we both have our faults but nothing feels better than over coming problems with him. Now i understand healthy love better and our relationship blossoms every day. 

When i am sad and i accept my emotions he helps me feel motivated again and gives the gentle care i can only get from him. When he gets tired of trying and he feels like giving into his worst thoughts i give him the tough love he can only get from me. I love that we understand how to help each other and as times have got harder and friends have shown themselves as foe nothing makes me feel more optimistic than knowing i have his back and he has mine.

It has always been hard for me to fit in, trust people or accept love and with his gentle approach to life and kind nature he has shown me i don't have to bottle up my emotions to get through the day and that people are better than i thought. It may seem odd that this is a big deal to me when im sure millions of couples understood the concept of being a team straight away but when you grow up defending yourself alone and always being on guard it feels amazing to have someone on your side watching out for you.

I have never loved anyone as much as i love him and i only wish there were words to explain to him how much i appreciate who he is and how much he has changed my life. I never thought i could love again after my past but i am happy for him to have proved me wrong again. ",love,1548385598,BedsocksToSchool,0,1,True,2019-01-24
464,Proof that the USA is not the country of Love,"Getting married after surviving a long distance relationship, we each other promised we would never stay apart. Call me stupid, or a girl, I cried so much when my wife and I were doing the long distance. I don't want to do it again.

Anyhow, after working for a few years, my wife wanted to finish the school that she started in the US. She had to come back to her country without her degree because of the financial crisis (and who caused it?).

Did you know that if you want to study in the US, you almost never can come with your husband /or wife?

The US government almost automatically declines if a couple applies together for a visa. (I wonder why even they allow people to apply that way)

Even when you have only one semester left to earn your degree, you may never come with your family.

2,3 years have passed since she got rejected her visa.

She is so proud of her school, but she cries whenever I mention her school or her time in the US.

Remember, she didn't cry when she had to come back due to the financial crisis. She didn't blame the US for that.

480,Today officially marks the longest we’ve ever gone without speaking. She still dominates my mind.,"It’s truly mind boggling how you can go two years talking to a person every single day all day. Then shit goes south and you stop talking all together. Someone who you had plans of marrying, having children with, have met their family, gone on trips together, etc. Now you’re just blocked out of their life all together. It’s truly a heart breaking experience and a pain that I wouldn’t wish on anyone, even my worst enemy. 

It’s now been 10 days since I spoke to her last. I was blocked in the middle of the conversation. I was told to email instead of venting to Reddit, as I’ve done, and have received no reply back since last Tuesday. I’m still struggling with the possibility of never speaking again or never seeing each other again when our last memory in person is such a positive one. I’m gutted, honestly. The fact you can leave one person so quickly and move on to start seeing someone else. It just cheapens the whole experience, makes it feel like you were just living some genjustu or lie. I gave everything but you couldn’t have to be gone so soon, to be moved on so soon. Or maybe it’s your way of coping and hiding things. One drug stops getting you as high so you run to the next one, rinse and repeat. 

You’d always tell me I was different and that souls come back to where they feel at home, yet I now feel like the most worthless of all. I feel like I gave the most and got the least of everyone. Even dudes that treated you like shit have you on Facebook still, or at least you told me they treated you like shit. Guys who “can’t stand” have you on snapchat and other apps. So why me? Why do I, the guy who you said yourself, was the kindest and most understanding, the person who when “most other guys would’ve told me to fuck off” stayed, I get this... anyone got an explanation that could explain this? I keep torturing myself.",love,1548461902,theguyfromuncle420,3,1,True,2019-01-25
481,You can't love someone without letting yourself suffer.,"Love is complicated, and it doesn't always involve getting what you want. It's about sacrifice and selflessness. It's about suffering and the expense of someone else's happiness. The last year I have one experience that sums this idea up. I was in a relationship the best one i have ever had this amazing and beautiful girl who just made me happy beyond anything, when I was with her I didn't care about anything but her, I just wanted to see her laugh and smile nothing else mattered, the problem in our relationship was that it had a time limit, because by the summer she was going on a study abroad and didn't want to do long distance The experience was heartbreaking as I did nothing wrong and everything ended on a technicality. Months afterwards, I finally found myself able to blame her for months of distress, maybe she had a choice to stay with me give up her dream but she didn't. And that's not fair to say or feel because logically the right thing to do was to let her go despite the negative impact it would have on me. But aside from that I should feel good about putting her first not guilting her for staying because she'd resent me for it, I can't tell her come back I miss you or I wish you never left or I am worried about you. Because its her time for fulfilment  to find out really what she wants and can't realise that whilst she's attached to me.",love,1548463565,totaldannation,2,1,True,2019-01-25

I heard from her friends she was obsessed with and when I asked her to hang several time she denied me. Recently I’ve also heard she’s obsessed with like 4 other guys. I feel like she has been playing with my emotions. And recently she stopped snap chatting me after we have been for the past 60 days.

After a couple of drinks later and getting to know each other, he invited me over and we started making out. One thing led to another and he stopped me from kissing him. He said he doesn’t think we have chemistry but I feel otherwise.  I think we do. I haven’t spoke to him since that night when he asked me to leave. It also took a toll on my self esteem and I started dwelling with the idea that I probably did something that made him fee uncomfortable.  I’m even playing with the thought of texting him and apologizing. I am honestly new to dating and still learning how to read people better.

488,Tonight was the night I realized I love my boyfriend,"So we have been dating for roughly a month now and when I’m with him I’m so happy. I always thought love in the movies didn’t exist, but when I am with him, I feel like I’m living in one of those movies. I don’t know why today felt so special... he called me, letting me know that his tires were being fixed and had to call into work and wanted to know if I would get him so we could hang out. When I got him we went back to his house and ate a huge plate of pizza rolls while talking about asmr videos and just goofing off. Then I sat by him and we cuddle while watching some tv. It’s so crazy how natural it feels being in his arms and that he genuinely feels the same way I do. I’m blushing just thinking about it. We decided to go to the park and have a little adventure but it was too cold so we went to the pet store and talked argued about what kind of puppy we should get in the future, a weiner dog of course, and ended up going into a near by store where we were pretending we were in an asmr video. We literally talked in whispers and tried to find the best things to make asmr. We ended up finding slime and got it and went to the bookstore next door. Everything we do together is so fun even if it’s childish sometimes, we always make each other laugh. The moment I knew though was when he was taking me home. There was music playing softly in the car, and i was looking over his face, ya know just really taking in what he looked like and he just seemed more attractive. He ended up looking at me and we just looked into each other’s eyes with goofy grins on our face, I was probably blushing too. But he grabbed my hand and kissed the back of it and I just kept thinking “I love you” it seems too early to say it but I just know. When he got to my house I kissed him goodnight like I always do before I leave, but this time was different. The kisses were so gentle and passionate, I didn’t want to stop. Ooh and I almost forgot, he always calls me sweetheart, he’s just so perfect. I always feel like I don’t get to spend enough time with him even though we hang out all the time. I’m just so happy to find what I have with him. ",love,1548485932,SaucyE1234,17,1,True,2019-01-26

492,To Whom It May Concern,"Today is my birthday.  Or it was yesterday (it's 2:44 a.m. to be exact).  I'm 43.  Yeah me!

What I really want for my birthday is love.  I have lots of love in my life and a bunch of folks came out for my birthday, so i'm talking about the deep one-on-one relationship, family, forever kind of shit. 

The truth is, I am blessed.  I have a great life, and a great job - I am a lawyer who works for himself. I only take cases I believe in. I have been the lawyer for a rockstar (while, kind of, I represented another party that had the exact same interests, so we worked together, and he even bought me lunch) I feel that I am pretty special, but also ridiculous .

Today, I took the day off, and went skiing at the local hill in British Columbia. I go with a woman friend and her kids.  She is an ex-client, I love them all.  We go a lot.

I just booked a trip with an ex-girlfriend of mine, who is now dating someone else.  We will share a bed.  What you should know about this person is that the first day I met her I told her I wanted kids.  She already had kids and was done.  It wasn't going to work, but we were way too connected.  I am friend's with this woman's ex-husband.  We literally hang out just the two of us (she doesn't live near me, he does).  Her eldest daughter called me on my birthday, and calls me her step dad. 

It's really not fair, but I live in abundance.  I have everything I need always. I have a past and baggage, and really don;t think I was truly able to love until a few years ago.

And yet, I get high virtually every evening. I have celibate for basically three years. I do not want to pretend I am perfect. Not even close.  But I do not control the people that I date to the point that we always become friends for life.  If we want to be together, both of us, and it works for both of us, amazing.  If not, then better not to pretend that it does.

The most important thing to me is truth, in all it's forms, and I just wish that I could meet that beautiful person to really love with all my heart.

I have so much more to say, but all words are contrived in some sense.  Please love, find me.

p.s. I know that if anyone reads this, they are mostly curious about the rockstar.  He is big in Canada, where I from, but most of the world will not have heard of him.  Now back to the love. (it's 3:14 now, not that it matters)...maybe I should wait till 3:16 so as to get that g-d boost............yup",love,1548501203,sin-ick,7,1,True,2019-01-26

For instance, he was a profesional gas-lighter and often told people he didn’t have a gf... then he justified it with “ I don’t  want people to thing you’re my property, you know, you’re an independent woman.” Mind you he seemed to only lie about me to other women, and even if they weren’t his type, it was strange. He also justified everything with the excuse that he was a poet and had to share his love poems with other women. Everyone around me thought he was so handsome, intelectual, polite and beautiful but now looking back at how ugly his persona was I can’t help but to see him in such an ugly light, such a turn off.

498,draft,"Looks like we got the first month of 2019 down with some of the heaviest baggage to handle: accepting the fact that it could end up being just another year without you. The physical you. The girl i fell in love with.The one whos invaded my every minute thought, and now the one who doubts my love.. While so much time has passed, that feeling has never faded, B. You are the first woman that has ever made me feel in such a way. You've shown me how far love stretches--infinitely beyond time and space. You've shown me how love can be as simple as your smile, or that minute of eternity in the basement with your arms around me.. I only have such limited memories of you and I. I wish you understood right now how this burden of fear is effecting me. Its paralyzing. I've been acting like an idiot. All dramatic and overly emotional. It's because you really make me feel.. im also a child and its typical behavior watching myself sabotage. i dont think its possible to fall out of love with you. Don't listen to your friends. I've accepted this role in the most unconventional love story ever told because i want you. finally. just you. I want to make real memories. i want to love with you. I want to travel. I want to hold your hand and feel more alive than i ever have. I want to spend every waking minute with you because I LOVE YOU and i'm a fucking asshole and a coward for not reminding you every day. I love you IB, and i want us to move forward together. in life. I couldnt imagine myself ever feeling this way about anyone else. i dont wan't anyone else.

I just wish you recognized that this format, this synopsis, the journey would be tumultuous by nature for anyone. ESPECIALLY  For someone whos so inherently down on themselves? Alternative psychology? y'know, im not the most equable man, so with the objective to let go and trust this natural flow, i'm lost in the sea of my own doubt anxiety and the melancholy of your absence. The paranoia doesn't help. Being around this phone..There are these misunderstandings and misinterpretations mixed with flared up emotions from checking unsent letters --illogical and irrational behavior= further regret and over-analyzation. The most important component of self growth isnt heard with ear or seen with the eye. We need to trust eachother and this game just isnt very conducive, but ill continue because i love you

The central concern for me is pretty easy to guess. Anyone whos been in a love triangle with someone you have such a magnetic electric connection with knows how distressing it is. Assuming you're with him nearly every waking moment isn't easy. Is it valid for me to ever have feelings of suspicion in the future? I don't want that. I want to trust him. i want to like him! we could be like brothers from diff mothers! but...he should be my egos nemesis! He gets to fulfill all of those immediate needs that i can't. You two are quite a team. Provocative and cut from the same cloth. Nearly identical. Am i jealous? yes! fuck yes i am!

Now in relation to unsent letters, the relentless mockery and trolling.. Those letters aren't really helping. Makes me question if this whole thing is a joke? its like im being taunted written by my false ego. You two have been living together for so long you can probably switch in and out of style or prose but..i dunno. the source matters. I want to trust the both of you. I want you b, to really look at who you want to spend your life with. He's you're best friend and i want to believe it. thats it. I'd stand up for both of you. I'm not sure if hes in love with you or vice versa or if you guys really have this perfect arrangement together. Its really important to me. I think about you two (too often) lol. 

Again, i want to apologize for not reminding you how much i love you, and how self centered and cowardice i've been. You are always on my mind, I just get so damn lost in it instead of telling you how amazing you are. I know we aren't in the best of places. We aren't where we were but id like to work on that.  I hope we're getting all of the negativity out of us now so when i see you again free of doubt and fear, i can hold you, take care of you, and love you the way you should be loved. I want you to feel safe with me. i love you Isabelle.

How happy she makes me. How anything she says if funny. How anything she does it cute. How everytime we kiss it feels like the first. How my heart stops when she speaks, only to resume when we touch. Love comes in many shapes/forms. But this love. The love I have for her. Is so incredibly strong. So unbreakable. That no matter what happens nothing can even come close as to weaken the way I feel towards her. I saw something a while back. About how a wife asked a husband how many times he thinks about her.

4,Love vs Career,"So our story is somewhat like this. We both met at the workplace (where we both were posted temporarily. Both of us were just out of bad relationships. As we became friends and liking each other, I realized that she was the one I had been looking for all this while. Exactly my type of person. And similarly I fit perfectly in her checklist too. We never thought someone like this could exist and have been together for almost a year now. It has been the happiest for us. We love each other to death.
She's emotionally a bit weak and has a dependant personality, not at all complaining, infact I love that part about her. She suffers from anxiety but she says that she finds peace in me.
So we've come to a situation where my parents are asking me to move to another country and continue my education there for 2-3 years, after which I can get married to her. But the issue is that she is too emotionally labile, she cannot handle the stress of being alone and the uncertainty will be bad for our relationship and take a toll on her mentally.

15,I realized my ex didn’t actually love me.,"  

I have never ever posted anything on here so bare with me. I also am not sure if it is in the right place. But I guess I am just here to do what everyone else has done- let it all out so this will be LENGTHY- however if anyone does take the time to read it. I will love you forever because other perspectives are always welcome. 

As the title says- that’s what we are here to do. 

We are going to call my ex John. I met him as a sophomore in college, He lived in a different country from me but it was only an hour and we were both raised military so we were both originally from the stats. We met in February of 2015 at a school tournament, a few short months later and thank goodness for Insta he asked me to be his girlfriend. And let me tell you this beforehand John is FTM transgender and that’s not really important here but just in case it’s necessary, I taught I’d let you know. 

So fast forward a lot of “breaks” on his end. Almost a 4 year relationship that was majorly long distance that and I mean this when I say it, the long distance was never in the issue. We used to take trains to see each other, we’d take advantage of the planes, and even ended in the same place for 6 months and it was amazing. 

John went to college and I told him this is your time if you want to fuck around or explore yourself I get it. I get what guys specially him who’d never really received that treatment from females because obviously the transition looked for in college. He said no, we got engaged LOL and things were good. Until 2018 rolled around – and well things started to go downhill. I had been there for the transition, the suicidal attempts, the constant reassurance, and everything he needed. But he just got so in over his head at college, and whilst struggling to figure out who the hell he is- he forgot I even existed., and literally we would go without days without speaking – so New Years rolls around and I get a I’m super drunk text and then nothing for 2 days because he had forgotten his charger. I was so angry because I hadn’t heard from him and it just blew up into a larger fight and I don’t think we ever really healed from that because he was under the impression he wasn’t making me happy. I ended things because I just couldn’t be with someone that just wasn’t putting in any effort. There was no display of like any kind of love- and I just stopped feeling like he gave a fuck at all and I remember the message I sent him and I still believe this- I love you unconditionally but if I am going to constaly feel alone dating you and being with you- I would rather be bymself and he just didn’t say anything. That was that- there was no argument. 

Fast forward 9 months all I can say is that my heart still hurts so much but the thing that I’ve realized as dramatic and intense as it sounds is that I don’t think he ever had the capability of loving me because he didn’t know how to do that for himself. There was so much I should have taken as a warning sign; when he told me he still loved his ex, when he lied to me about me actually making him cum during sex, when he threatened to take pills if I was too leave; when he asked me for space or to change the titles on our relationship whilst still keeping me around; when he took the engagement back after he was the one that wanted me to marry me. So many things- I didn’t I stayed around and built him up. 

So I guess I am just here to see what other people think. I am sorry if this doesn’t make sense I tried to not make it like the novel it is- I just wanna hear what all of you think.  ",love,1544046378,dxs1997,9,1,True,2018-12-05

17,This guy offered me HIS COAT after knowing me for 3 MINUTES,"Now I know as much, if a guy offers to make a girl warm it just means he wants to take care of you. It's simple and so sweet you have to love it.

Last Friday I was standing on a train station, waiting  for a train that was 30 minutes late. This sweet guy came to me as he saw two guys approach me first and ask me for my phone to make a call. One those two had blood coming from his nose or mouth and they wanted to call the police and because of blood they looked dangerous.  Then guys left and I told the sweet guy I was going to airport and hoped the train was not more late than already is. Dude had this amazing calming effect on me. Surely he wouldn't even catch my eye on a street but when we talked our conversation flowed normally, like we've known each other for ever. But I don't ever disturb strangers on train stations as I have many bad experiences with this so after this said alright bye and walked away. 

As we were still waiting a while longer I saw the dude again. I wasn't sure if he was looking at me or not in the dark at the station, but I thought I would tell him the exact delay of the train which I was sure he didn't know. Then asked me what will I do if I don't catch the flight, and I asked him what he will do if he misses his connecting train. THEN he said that I must surely be cold waiting outside for so long (which already made me feel warm inside!) , and I said I WAS COLD. 

And classic, then he said DO YOU WANT MY COAT? 

Sadly I had to DECLINE. I wrote here all we ever said to each other, I didn't know the dude at all. 

He looked down sad for a moment and just slowly moved away few inches. I was also typing a message that was urgent (because of my flight) and didn't notice all he was doing and was also expecting him to talk to me more after saying THAT, but he didn't. 

And then he did something that made me sad. He asked someone else at the station to borrow a phone because his phone was dead. He didn't ask me despite already talking to me before. 

The guy was not shy, but was introverted like me, seemed confident and composed. Didn't seem creepy or desperate at all. 

But why offer a coat so soon ? Maybe talk a little more first? Would you guys do that ? It didn't seem like this was his only and desperate way to tell me that he liked me, it seemed more like he just wanted to help me.

I would love to hear any thoughts on this. Thank you very much.

29,Him,"

I think about you everyday. We've been friends for five years. Two years ago you told me how you felt about me. Nothing was the same ever since. I realized how much you liked me, and then consequently how much I liked you. 
You moved away, probably thinking I didn't feel the same way. But now have feelings for you. I realized that the dream guy I always imagined for me was you. You have all the characteristics of my dream guy. Handsome, but more importantly incredibly intelligent. You are hardworking, focused, goofy, sensitive, kind, and you even get along with and fit in with my family. 

I don't know why it took me so long to realize that I like you. I didn't realize it until I moved away. Now, I feel like it's too late. You've probably already met someone better than me; you've probably moved on. I'm trying to prepare myself for seeing you with someone else.
But, there's a flicker of hope that those feelings you told me about two years ago never went away, that somewhere deep down you still feel the same way. I know I do.

34,Incomplete: A Modern Love Story by Kobra,"It was never about the idea of you, it was you. I never wanted a relationship, I told myself there was no way I'd ever consider marriage again before we met. But between all of the little things, the big things, the things others may never even notice...every single part that makes you who you are...I fell for it all. 

Within 2 weeks i was in a cloud of feelings I had never remotely felt, I wasn't scared I wanted more..i wanted to feel how you made me feel everyday. The first year or so I had to downplay my feelings and thoughts, you couldn't know how I really felt. I was worried I would scare you away, I had to lie to myself and convince myself I could care less. 

I tried to shield and detach myself from developing feelings for liam because he wasn't my child. I tried to protect myself in case something like all of this ever happened by lying myself and not being who I truly wanted to be. It didn't last long, within a few months I found myself thinking about little things he did and thinking of something cute he said to me or did referring to me as mac. I felt like I was a superhero. 

Not being able to have children and not having much experience i was always deathly afraid to as much as hold a baby. I had always viewed myself as a broken misfit toy, no real grown self respecting women could ever desire to be with me for an extended period of time. I was someone maybe you would have a little fun with but never even tell your friends about let alone introduce to your parents. Of course I never thought a responsible mother would want me to be a part of raising a child, and even if she did odds are I would find a way for it to all to go terribly, things Kobra usually does. 

So when all of these things occurred, and i was someone you could be proud to show off. Or watch your children, help raise them..I was on cloud nine. This was it, she is the one...I am going to get that white picket fence and family I've always secretly desired more than anything. 

My life and overall outlook on life has always been unorthodox, but ultimately when I had dreams of what I wanted my future to be..it was living in a little 3 bedroom house with a nice house and white picket fence. Nothing too fancy but in a quite neighborhood. Having a loving household and above all finding this vague undefined blur that was my dream girl. 

I never really had any types or ideal looks of who I desired, all I knew is I wanted it to be someone that was worthy of all the love I had to give, someone sarcastic enough to confuse me regularly with jokes. Someone who had the drive to become the best version themself, to become successful in life, someone that looked at me and it was like the world stopped and began to revolve around us. 

There I was having found this person, who was almost a mythical figure..progressing in our lives together..ups and downs...a myriad of tiny microscopic moments...each being the best moment in my life...over and over. Each day with her is the best day of my life….over and over. I became spoiled almost, I had stockpiled a million glances of your beautiful eyes staring into my soul...small memories that seem like almost nothing in the moment. I became spoiled...i took those for granted. I just assumed we would live happily ever after no matter what. How could we not...time passes..stress builds...money is tight...spirits are low. 

The millions of microscopic moments begin to be more spread out...I still don't notice. I'm still in a fog, a feeling of invincibility that I have acquired being with you also doubles as numbness and tunnel vision. 

And here we are...would I rather things had went more like the storybook it began as...yes. I have no idea what the rest of our story entails, but one thing I know with all my heart...this isn't the way the story ends. And maybe one day our lives can become the wonderful picturesque illustration I had always dreamed about. I can only hope by reading this you begin to understand that we are meant to write the rest of the pages to this story together…..

36,Letting go pt III,"I've almost let go. I'm almost free again. It's just the fear of going back there again that keeps me holding on to my self-imposed emotional cage, going back to the confidence and openness that makes me think I can be vulnerable without being hurt. So here I am, listening to her [last.fm](https://last.fm) just like the delusional-obsessive 17-year-old I still am at heart, and spending an hour every night searching for anything at all about her on google and hating myself for still being this way, despite everything I have learned about what it means to be human since I was 17. It's like I'm standing on the other side of a window and looking at myself destroying myself. Just because it's a known quantity and makes no demands upon me. If I broke through that window and wrestled the laptop from my hands and somehow could sleep instead, I would just find someone else to put on that pedestal and start the cycle again. Or so my depression tells me... Who can say. Who can say.  


The first part of the cycle is feeling free and valued by others and myself. The second part is infatuation. The third part is rejection and obsession, that is the worst part and the one I truly fear - that's when I go into the cage and stop caring for myself or living up to my responsibilities - but the fear is due to the twisted enjoyment I get out of it, I'm addicted not to love or beautiful women but to emotion itself, no matter which - it's just that this is the only one I \*want\* to feel, so I let it dominate my world. The fear that I will never come out of it. Now I'm in the fourth stage, obsession and depression, when I can't imagine anyone other than POSSIBLY my mother holding anything but thinly veiled contempt for me. When I no longer feel strongly, but am still debilitated. After that comes the fifth and final stage, emptiness and the waning of the depression indicated by brief moments of torrential anxious infatuation.  


So that was nr. 19. Who will nr 20 be? How could I believe that I will have time to change before I fall again? If the schedule holds it will be sometime around mid april, with at most a month of being able to feel again. Even with weekly sessions and the strength to stay clean, as soon as I'll be feeling okay again I just fall right down, at the first given opportunity. A tender glance or a fingertip against the back of my hand, that might be all it takes. ",love,1544124450,id_really_prefer_not,0,1,True,2018-12-06
37,I find my boyfriend's heart defect very sexy,"Obviously not the heart defect itself, but the fact that he survived a heart transplant (and his heart didn't go into rejection right away) and several open heart surgeries not only makes me inspired by him but also very attracted to him.

Not to mention, he has liver and kidney problems because of this defect that does not seem to hinder his ability to be happy and live life. He is always so happy with me. He has this sense of invincibility that not many people have and I find it SO attractive.

I think his scars are super hot too. I always trace them or kiss them when I lay with him. I don't know what it is about them but I just find them very attractive. He has some on his neck too from IVs in the past. The little dents, marks, and redness on him I find very sexy and they are some of the things I like most about him physically.

He thinks he can never die (not quite literally, but he lives life in a very carefree attitude).

I don't know why, but it makes me see him as someone strong and very spiritual. Like, he really played Gxd in a way (that's how he likes to put it). He had a high chance of dying and he overcame that.

He doesn't even see this defect and transplant as a big deal. He says it's what's normal for him and he doesn't know any other way, which, in my opinion, is quite humble. He could brag about it and tell everyone about it but he chooses to keep it to himself unless someone asks about his scars.",love,1544128084,princessrachela,0,1,True,2018-12-06

I practically drove off of a building in the hopes that the concrete at the bottom would be soft. But of course it wasn't.  Now, this isn't the first time I've felt a form of heartbreak, but it's the first time that the things I felt passion for have lost color. I loved writing. I loved thinking of storylines, characters, development. Everything writing related was my passion. She edited for me which was a part of why I fell in love with her.

It took me another 2 years to get myself back together from that because I was completely heartbroken. I think about him every day still and I wonder if I still love him because it kind of feels like I do but I try to block those emotions. He has a girlfriend now and he had messaged me a few months ago behind her back (he told me they were broken up which was a lie) and he told me he missed me and loved me and I knew I had to tell him I didn’t love him back because I would’ve ended up hurt if I told him how I felt. He was abusive and manipulate and it probably makes me sound so stupid to say I miss a guy like that, it wasn’t always like that though. I’m glad I’m not with him anymore because I’m a lot stronger now and I know I don’t need a guy to be happy. Back then I looked for love in all the wrong places because if I didn’t have a man I felt unloved, and that’s wrong. I know it was a toxic relationship. I’m afraid to date now because of that relationship, yet I still miss that guy. I hate that I can still care about someone who put me through what he did, but here I am crying as I type this. I really wish I didn’t love him as much as I did. When he told me forever I really did believe he meant it, but I was obviously wrong. Why do I still care about someone like that? It’s been 2 and a half years by now since we’ve been broken up. I thought now that we’ve graduated and I didn’t have to see him at school anymore that I’d get over it but I still feel the same.

60,[Vent] Should I even pursue this?,"In short, I (19F) am very close to my best friend (F), we are online friends, voice chat every day all day, super close. In the past phone sex, nudes, lingerie. You know that stuff. Our friendship was much more a relationship but we didnt want to rush things before we met in person. (Hell I told her I thought I was in love)

Last week I slept with my ex who I dated for 4 years. The thought ate me up, I wasnt officially with this girl I liked, but I felt so fucking sick. 

So I ended up telling her, I felt awful, I just needed it out, god I wish I hadn't said anything at all though. She basically told me it wouldn't work out, her reasons were valid, that we are still friends, and I can still come see her for the Christmas holidays which is when we will meet for the first time in person. 

I meet her in 4 days. Shes the kind of girl I wouldnt exspect to change her mind, and I've taken everything she said serious and to heart. But I cant get over her in a week, probably not even a month. 

I feel dumb because I told myself it would happen like this, I dunno what I'm asking anymore, I just know I want her back. I dont want to get over her, but I dont want to chase her and be that kind of annoying friend.

67,"This, is my (non) love story","Today I'm going to share with you what was my short love story and how it never really ended.

It was summer 2 years ago, a friend and I were going on vacations to the beach, we always went together on vacationa with our families and this was gonna be a perfect week.

A month before we went to the beach my friend told me his sister (which is 2 years younger than us) was bringing a friend, I didn't really care at the moment and I forgot about it.


We'll call John my friend and Sarah will be his sister.

So this is it, this is going to be the best week of the year, we just having fun at the beach, I have just arrived and... Wait, who's that girl? Oh yeah yeah it's Sarah's friend, alright I am not even planing on talking with her.

I am bored, John is playing a game on his phone, I'll step outside, grab my guitar and play some tunes.

I was there, grabbing my guitar when Sarah comes and says: ""Hey psychedelik! Do you know Kelsey does also sing? Come with us let's sing together""

I accepted, I love singing and playing the guitar and that's even better when people sings with me.

We sang two songs and that was it, I probably only said to Kelsey something like: Yeah we can sing Perfect from Ed Sheeran, do you know the lyrics?

After that we decided to go to the beach, I played some voleyball with Kelsey on my team, she seemed pretty shy but... She was also very fun!

The next day after eating John and Sarah were watching TV, so I decided to step outside and play the guitar, I was just playing when I saw Kelsey, I don't know why but I felt like I needed to socialize with her, also, I love singing with someone else.

So I said: Hey! You sing right? Wanna sing?

She said yes, and we sang some songs... After that... Well we just kinda clicked, I don't know how to say it but we were together most of the time sharing stories, singing... We had a lot of fun.

I asked her phone so we could hang out when we got back to our city, and she gave it to me, I was obviously into her, and she was into me.

The last night at the beach we stayed until 4:30 am just talking and laughing all night, very near... But nothing happened.

We went back to the city but we both had to go somewhere else so we kept talking by phone, until one day we were both back home and hanged out... And... We kissed.

I just know that kiss was... Different, I can't describe it I just felt everything was perfect for a second.

We hanged out for a month or so, but some night I got a message from her.

She told me she wasn't sure what ""our thing"" was and she had some personal problems and didn't want us to continue having that kind of relationship, she broke my heart, I literally was going to ask her out (she was never really my girlfriend).

Turned out she met some guy at the school and she started liking him and he was flirting with her.


Here is where everything goes... Down.

They started dating but I had ""forgotten"" her (that's what I thought) and I met a friend of her (let's call her Marta).

I liked Marta and we started dating, I saw Kelsey once every 2-3 months and every time I saw her she had problems with his boyfriend, still I thought he was a good guy so I kind of told her he was just being childish but he probably didn't want to hurt her.

Five months after dating Marta I realized I still loved Kelsey (it had been almost 1 year since that summer), I broke up with her and that was it, neither Marta or Kelsey really knew why.

I started to hang out more with Kelsey and we sang and she again, told me she had problems with her boyfriend, I just knew I had so much fun with her, I felt so good around her...

So one day I couldn't act anymore and she realized something was off.

The next day she told me by message that I was weird and she got me to admit I was still, after more than a year, in love with her.

I wasn't sure if she felt something because that last day she had layed on me and more things that made me think she might feel something.

She didn't, she said she had feelings for me back that summer, but she loved her boyfriend and that was it.

I stopped talking with her.


This was two months ago, I can't get her out of my mind, it's been like this for more than a year, I just can't, I can't forget that summer and what she makes me feel.

I feel so bad, I love her but she doesn't love me back... 

The worst part is knowing she had feelings some time, but she doesn't anymore...

I don't know what to do, I just cant forget her, I... Just can't.

I love her.",love,1544229692,Sychedelik,6,1,True,2018-12-07
68,"I need some advice, what to do after a confession.( Its lenthy, and i would appreciate anyone who reads it and hives any advice) ❣️","I confessed to my crush, for the first time,(a kinda distant friend) over text, and got no response from him, and i apologized for making it awkward, but afterwards, we stopped talking to each other. I couldn't get the courage to talk to him, and he did wave and smile at me, but just didn't talk. 

I gave us two days to cool down, but I'm desperately trying to repair ourl relationship as friends, I'm want to be able to talk to him again. I'm thinking of using text to resolve the problem, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea.I was so impatient with my emotions. We made alot of eye contact, and I could feel that I HAD a good impression on him. He looked at me everytime he laughed, and would copy the silliest things I did, it's was...cute. 

We were both shy, but I'm even more shy, being social awkward, yet always wishing I could be more outgoing. It was difficult for me to keep a good conversation with him, there would often be awkward silence. Although it was a bit hard to find a common intrest, I found out that we both liked dancing.

 Anyways, there just so many things that showed that he liked me back. The problem is that I speak before I think, and I thought that when I confessed, he would respond,but he didn't. Maybe he wasn't ready, or in the end, I got the wrong idea. I honestly couldn't tell. I often get really open in texts that I typed the words ""I love You"" without thinking of the situation. We weren't close friends, and I barely started texting him a week ago, and I already screwed up.

 I don't even care if we're aren't in a romantic relationship anymore, I really want to at least go back to being friends. Is there anyway I can do it, and if so when would be a good time to approach this?",love,1544235516,AquaniteX,13,1,True,2018-12-07

I met someone recently, I didn’t expect anything to come of it. You see a guy and think to yourself “oh he’s cute” and then get on with your day. Then you start to get to know this person, and you think to yourself “OMG I literally love you (non-romantically), what a cool guy, I hope we get to hang out more, we have so much in common”. Time goes on, and you don’t even realise that you’re slowly falling for this person the more you hang out. Then all of a sudden it hits you, that they like you! Initially you try not to think anything of it, then you slowly realise how happy you feel when you’re around them, and how lonely you feel when you’re not. I’ve been trying to figure out in my mind how I feel. Just 5 minutes of your time makes my entire day better. I find it hard to digest that something could feel so comfortable, and come so naturally. So here’s where it takes a darker twist, we’ve had to keep our feelings for each other a secret from the other, which in turn has caused us both so much pain. All I’ve wanted is to just hold you in my arms, as close as I hold you in my heart, but knowing I couldn’t has been torture. Now I fear I may never even see or speak to you again, and without even getting to say goodbye. I do understand it’s probably for the best perhaps, but I just don’t want to accept that. I want to break the rules and risk it all, I know what I feel is genuine now, nothing could ever hurt this much if it wasn’t real.

72,One Smile,"I thought I was over her, I was so sure of it, until she smiled again to me a couple of days back, the worst part is, I know it will never work beteween us and yet after a whole year I still have feelings for this girl

To give context, I met her last year when she was a freshman, she didn't catch my interest at first even tho she is beautiful, I thought that she was this tipcal girl with generic tastes and generic sense of humour, I feel bad for judging her just by the first impression and with those terms, but I actually started to talk to her and found out that we have a lot in commun, she was shy, shared a lot of my nerdy interests and even had a witty sense of humour, she was also really nice, we really liked talking to each other, even tho I don't remember the first time I talked to her since I was blacked out drunk, the next day she came up to me and said ""do you remember anything from yesterday?"" To which I replied ""no... what happened?"" ""At the club you randomly aproached me and asked if I prefered Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan"" you can imagine my inner thoughts ""What the fuck is wrong with me, why? Why would I say that?"" But she said ""don't worry, it was a fun talk and since some other drunk guy grabbed my ass a bit before that so I'd say that your drunk self could be worse"" she added ""I prefer Anakin btw"" that went much better than excpected.

So yeah, after that we talked naturally and before long I found myself falling for her, everytime I was close to her, talking to her I just felt... so damn good because I felt that I had a change and I loved that my company was being enjoyed by someone I really liked, I decided to ask her out and to my surprise, she said yes, damn I was so happy that day, little did I know that the next day would be so fucking horrible

Basicly the next day there was this huge party in the whole town and me being me, I got passed out drunk, the biggest regret of my life to this day because while I was passed out, she was making out with the fuckboy of the class for the first time, I only found out the next day at party tho, so... that didn't go well since I started crying and she noticed, she came to talk to me about it saying that she likes me very much but she knew that being with me meant being in a serious relationship and she wasn't ready for that, she was afraid to end up hurting me, to this day I still don't know if she meant it or she was just trying to not make me feel as bad since I knew she is the kind of person who prefers being nice over being honest, needless to say her chosing the fuckboy over me was like my self esteem was punched in the face and ran over by a car it was probably the biggest heartbreak of my life

Anyway those two end up ""dating"" and this is where I start doing stupid shit, really stupid shit, sending her messages while drunk talking about this whole thing and how I felt, messages which made me regret being born when I checked them the next day, everytime I got drunk near her I'd do or say someting stupid to the point I nearly started a fist fight with the guy, and it's dumb because he did nothing wrong but I had this irracional hate for him at the time turns out that the thoughts you repress in your mind while sober tend to come out while drunk, who knew. Still I eventually learnef my lesson and crotrolled myself with how much I drunk. But damn, even after all of this she still says she likes me a lot and wants to be good friends, she was really patient with me and understanding

They broke up for a while now since she started having real feelings for him so he ditched her, even tho I felt really sorry for her I couldn't help but feel glad, he didn't deserve her, and honestly, neither do I, I screwd up too much, she's better off without both of us

So this is it, my very long dumbass story of how I fucked everything up by being almost a alcoholic, so kids, stay away from that shit and if you made it this far, seriously? Go give your SO all the atention they deverse instead of reading some random stranger's story about his faliure as a human being, but for real now, Thank you a lot for reading

78,My crush got married yesterday,"I hang out with a couple, they’re my friends. We met tonight for drinks and they wanted me to be the first to know about them getting married. “We got married. All the paper was signed yesterday”, one of them told me. I was surprised, to say the least. I was so happy for them. I screamed like a maniac, inside I was very happy for them. But I’ve been having feelings for one of them almost a year ago when we all first met.

I’m not a bad friend. I never want to hurt them. That’s why I have always been focusing on the fun times we spent together. Part of me hopes something can happen in 10, 15 years when I get older and my crush won’t think I’m a kid anymore (they’re 10 years older than I am). I don’t do anything to hurt their relationships, I don’t even wanna think about it. I just want to be around, make her happy. They’re so much in love, and that hurts me sometimes. We’re very close, the three of us. 

Now that I know they’re getting married. I know it won’t change a thing about our relationships. It’s just, I missed my chances. I had no chance with my crush. And I feel a bit sad. It was just like a dream. It hurts me a little knowing how much they love each other to have come to this decision, even though I and the person I like still have little moments together; I was led on by the moments; now I know it’s not gonna matter anymore. 

I’m just putting it here and will wrap my feelings up. Tmr we will hang out again, their love is still there. It’s ok I got used to it long ago.

82,love,"this is a love letter for \*\*\*\*

\------------------------------------------------------

i always thought love is when you have those butterflies in your stomach

isn't that what it's supposed to be?

that was until i met, well let's call her dee 

dee makes me feel something i've never felt before

it's weird because she makes me feel the butterflies 

in my heart

instead of my stomach

which i didn't know was possible

but she did it 

another thing dee made me realize is that 

when you love someone

they have no flaws, genuinely. 

like i recognize the things i usually would consider to be ""turn offs"" on dee, but she just makes them look so beautiful and cute 

dee always seems to be on my mind even if im not fully aware of it, she's there

she makes me n my heart happy

so happy

like the bad stuff in the world doesn't exist

see when im with dee i feel like i could just lay there with her

for hours, doing absolutely nothing

just her next to me, listening to her breath 

hoping she doesn't hear my heart speed up

dee also made me realize that sex isn't that great

she literally made the ""sex is cool n all but "" meme come to life

like i thought it was all a joke till she held my hand the first time

honestly this might sound fake, but when i hold hands i just think to myself

""this is all i need, just this. if i could just hold her hand forever id be the happiest person on earth, this is it, this is the goal."" 

dee scares me

i havent been attached to someone, ever. 

but i think she's got me hooked

ive had crushes before but this is not even a crush anymore

I have basically attached myself to him because he is just amazing and I feel pretty happy around him. He is so cute and sweet that I want to be by him all the time. I want to be in his arms and I want him to tell me that everything is going to be okay. I want to just cuddle with him every night because it gets pretty cold at night. It would be nice to just lay with him in bed as we watch the rocky movies. Since its something he would like m to watch. Pick me up and spin me around like Ill always be yours or just hug me tightly. Or as we lay in the grass and see the clouds moving I just want to here you talking about yourself. Like you know some things about me but i dont know so much about you. Like what do you enjoy doing or your favorite food. I'm falling for him like crazy because he just seems like he is good for me because my gut is telling me he's not bad. His eyes are also so calm and soft but I can't tell if I see sadness or happyness in his eyes. Now when something happens a lot things are going to fall apart for me. I'm going to be left heartbroken like always and I'm just going to cry every night in constant pain. Like right now I feel that pin in my chest and I really dont like this feeling. I thought I would be okay with being hurt at the end but I was lying to myself.

So there's this man.We met almost 2 years ago, and he brings sunshine into my every day life. Our families have become each other's families over this time. 

So there's this man. We come from very different places in America, but we have so much in common.

So there's this man. He's my biggest fan, and supports everything I do. I do the same for him.

So there's this man. I want to spend the rest of my life with him. I want to marry him. There is no one like him in the world. 

So there's this man. He loves me like no one ever has, and the feeling is mutual. I don't know what I did to deserve him in my life. But whatever it was, I'm forever glad that I did it.

So there's this man. He shows compassion and respect to everyone he meets, regardless of who they are or where they come from.

So there's this man. He helps those in need and is the hero of so many. He is my hero.

So there's this man.... He leaves for deployment in one week. One more week of falling asleep beside one another. One more week of soft kisses when he goes to work in the morning and I'm still half asleep.

So there's this man..... and I'll ALWAYS be here for him, (not so) patiently waiting for him to come home. ",love,1544336035,mg17k,4,1,True,2018-12-09
92,Love comes in many shapes,So I fell for a girl hard 2 years ago. I was in the same circle of friends as her but on the other side I guess like we really didn’t talk much. Well over the next year I built courage and asked her out in August. Got and answer that was “I’m not in that place in life right now.” I was confused as in she liked me just not now or didn’t like me at all. So over the next 4 months I fall into a not gonna say depression but a phase of big sad. And i thought about it every day. Nothing had meaning but her. Well talking to her best friend one night be I’m her best friends other best friend. And her friend told me to get it all off my chest and let her know. I told her it all and halfway through telling her I love her I realized it wasn’t romantic. Just because she’s attractive doesn’t mean it has to be like that. I loved her as a person and loved her as a friend. I assumed I was looking for a gf but realized I was really looking at my best friend. I loved her like family. And now the 3 of us are best friends who go out on the weekends just being kids. And I realized that love isn’t all about romance. You can love your friends too. And well I love my friends more than anyone. And they saved my life. They allowed me to open up and they trust me to open up to me. So we build each other up helping each other through the day. I love her still. As a friend. Don’t go chasing girls because you need a girlfriend sometimes you just need a friend.,love,1544340192,2dank4stank,0,1,True,2018-12-09

94,So I don’t know what to do...,"For a long time, I’ve known this one particular girl for what feels like eternity - we’ve been great friends for longer than a decade, always have a fantastic time whenever we speak and chat. 

I can remember the night I met her, and the feelings I had then, over a decade ago, and she’s still as beautiful (if not more gorgeous) than when I met her many years ago, and I never stop smiling when I see her.

However as luck would have it, she and I have been friends forever - and never dated, as much as I have said over the years that I would love to, she’s turned me down as she doesn’t want to ruin the friendship and closeness we have...

For over 10 years I have tried to move on, tried to stop loving this amazing soul...for all this time we always get one another, there’s just...something about her that I can’t get past, and as a forewarning - I’ve expressed throughout the years to get a chance, just a simple chance to court her, just once. To that, she’s always said she wouldn’t want to ruin the friendship (neither do I, but I just can’t help but feel like we both want more, but she’s reserved to saying “no” to more).

99,Take it or leave it,"I met this girl, in a class last year, we were just friends of friends. she was so cute and giddy all the time. then when the guy she had been dating. we hung out with a group of friends, she was crying in the back of the car. then as 4th of july came, she we had been texting a lot, she literally typed :) or ;) every other text. but at fireworks our friend definitely sat right inbetween us which was kinda funny, completely oblivious. week or so after we sorta just cuddled. She is my first kiss (for another story), at an amusement park, cute right lol. we’ve been great. but just asit had started, we were strong but then once the cold days starting hitting, the winds starting to freeze, last month november (also my birthday). Things had been rough with work ( she had been closing a lot missing out on schoolwork) and i had been busy too. she asked me if we could talk about something before we hungout. we met at a park, the rest of our friends in the car, she told me that its been rough with her and that she feels it isnt two sided. that i dont give enough effort. that i dont give her the time of day. that she feels like she talks to a wall. so this is completely prevalent in all cases but— when we hangout in real life. our fun little dates, the days we hangout, i love them so much, our love is quite mature i feel, its so accepting and we dont care about the little picky things and the little things are what make up smile. but texting, we go to different schools, i never see her anymore, her new school is really rough and the teachers are all new, she isnt doing great in school because of it. i play a lot of video games, meaning i text on usual intervals based on what game i play, and so when im doing those i dont text back too often, leading to relatively dry conversations. but sometimes i feel like she doesnt care about our real life interactions where i smile, she smiles, we laugh, we love. but when she said that i teared up, i couldnt handle the thought of losing her, it was one of the first time my depressionistic thoughts returned when in the presence of her (i used to have terrible anxiety and panic attacks before till my last breakup were i felt broken) and so she comforted me like the saint she is, and she said things like “ive talked to (name of friend in the car) and she thinks that i know what i deserve and that if you cant give me that, i need to know now so i don’t hurt myself more. (that is important so hold onto that)in short of that conversation, we sorted things out and we went on to have a (sleep deprived) fest with our friends it was so fun. then as time passed she would bring it up in hints now and then. and then again, about week or a couple later i couldnt stop thinking about all the stressors i have (which are few in comparison) and i just sat there mute, couldn’t say a word, she stayed as long as she could because she knew i would cry, she left the car to walk round a little bit (she has some health problems) and i instantly started crying tearing up, no muscle moving staring into the grass in front of where we were parked, she didnt notice at first and then she helped me out. and a few weeks ago we were in my car (my self-esteem had not been high) having an alright time, just jammin to music. and we talked of memories and such. and then i ruined it; i talked of how ugly i was  and i broke i literally couldnt get myself around it, i thought of how perfect she was and i didn’t understand why she liked me i literally had “put her through hell” (quote from my ex before that in how she described our relationship in which i was the one giving too much and is the reason i dont try as much in texting anymore) and i realized how i am average. i am just like everyone else if not worse, anyone could do what i did to love her, i was not special. of course thats not how she viewed it and she did everything she could in her power to fix it. of course i just put it at the back of my mind after like 45 minutes or so of wasting her time, and we continued for the rest of her night. at one point she texted me saying that she just wanted to kiss me and she felt like a hoe, at the time i felt the same i had dreamed about it several times, i thought about it a bunch. but then we got busy we haven’t hung out on a weekend for a couple weeks last week she texting me the same thing she said before. starting with “do you even like me anymore (she had said this a couple of times before)” and i said that she knows the answer, that just because we had hung out a week or so prior having a good time. but she said that she knew what she deserved and that we made need a break or something. and what she brought up that sealed the deal was something along the lines of “(my name), do you still have bad thoughts? cause i dont think you can love me until you love yourself” sort of thing. and i’ve had really hard time with self esteem because of every breakup ive had. my friend actually said that exact same line when he broke up with his ex- that he didnt love himself yet, but i dont see myself like him. i dont see myself living my life in arrogance, in loving myself, i would rather be selfless in my love and service. but now we are almost to the present to where shes been losing sleep in crying. about this, in worryingg about me and my decisions in depression, in her school and work, which she seems to be doing really rough be recently alright. where i am in limbo not knowing what to do taking my time probbably slowly losing my chances and getting her back. she has been the most real love i have ever loved, as far as i can see, she is the best one ive ever had. i dont see myself getting anyone else better than her. but i dont think i can get back with her just to start a cycle to hurt her again, to not be there when she needs me, and making a breakup then even more monumental. i had been so busy this week, i had a funeral of my grandfather and i have been with my cousins all week, i have been distracted. im worried about her but also i think that im average and there are plenty of guys that would be better for her. but i think i still love her, shes amazing shes so pretty, but i dont think im good enough for her. do i end “us” or continue with the risk of the cycle returning?",love,1544343846,xDubfox,0,1,True,2018-12-09

105,Not your typical Tinder story,"I’m a traveling therapist, which means I move every 3 months. I think it’s safe to say I have commitment issues, well until now. I recently came home to spend 2 weeks with family and while home I met a man. Our love story is unconventional to say the least. Friday 11/16, Bryan and I had our first date, both of us were smitten.  The next morning I picked up Bryan and brought him over to my mom’s to hang with me and a friend. He ended up staying with my family for the remainder of my time at home. It didn’t take long for my family to fall in love with Bryan and before I knew it he asked both my mom and grandmother for permission to date me. At the time when I agreed to be his girlfriend, I knew it was completely crazy but assumed it would quickly fizzle out once I left for my next contract in Hawaii. Little did we know 2 weeks later I would be leaving hawaii to come back home to hold his hand while he is on life support fighting for his life.

Wednesday 11/21 Bryan woke up with a sore throat and by the end of the night he had spiked a fever of 103.8. His mother took him to urgent care that following Friday and he was sent home with a diagnosis of the flue and strep. Despite antibiotics and rest Bryan was deteriorating quickly. 

Monday 11/26: Bryan texted me that his temperature dropped to 96.6. I call him immediately and speak with his mother to explain that Bryan is going septic and needs to be taken to the ER immediately. He was admitted into the ICU at the local hospital but given the severity of his condition he was airlifted to a larger hospital that could offer specialized care. 

Tuesday 11/27: I get the call from his mom that he has severe sepsis due to complications of the flu and pneumonia. Despite the doctor’s best efforts he continues to deteriorate. 

Thursday 11/29: I’m sitting in my car outside of a coffee shop with this overwhelming feeling that I need to come home and by 10:30pm HST I’m on a plane headed for Chicago. I land Friday afternoon and my mom drives me straight to the hospital. When I arrive to his room I’m pleasantly surprised to see him sitting up, smiling, talking and eating. His mom brief’s us that infectious disease stepped in yesterday and discovered Bryan does not have the flu or pneumonia. She switched him to a full spectrum antibiotic and sends off blood and sputum cultures off to the labs. The plan was to stay the night with Bryan however the night nurse wasn’t comfortable with the idea and sent us home. I said my goodbyes to Bryan but felt reassured that I would see him tomorrow and could head back to Hawaii early next week. 

Saturday 12/1: I get a call from Bryan’s mom telling me Bryan took a turn for the worse and that I need to get to the hospital. We finally have a diagnosis, Lemierre’s Syndrome along with ARDS. Bryan at this point can no longer breath on his own and the doctors decide to intubate. I’m allowed a few minutes with Bryan before they put him under. We exchange an “I love you” and I hold his hand telling him it’s going to be okay as I watch tears stream down his face.  We are kicked out of the room. Saturday was rough, he coded twice and the chaplain was called in. I thought this was it but he somehow made it through the night. 

Sunday 12/2: The doctors make the decision it’s time for ECMO (life support) and he’s swiftly taken into surgery. Surgery goes smoothly and he’s taken up to the cardiovascular ICU and here we will wait by his side, praying and hoping for a miracle. 

Tuesday 12/4: This was it the doctors told us, it’s time to prepare for the worse. I stayed by his side most of that afternoon, holding his hand telling him I loved him. There was a brief moment where he turned his head towards me, trying to open his eyes and squeeze my hand back. I told him to keep fighting and that he was going to be okay and then our moment was gone. The machines are going crazy, his O2 and BP are dropping, the doctors kick us out and all we hear “he’s going to die if we don’t do something now!” 

Wednesday 12/5: Bryan is still with us and a miracle started to take form. Chest x-rays are starting to show improvement in his lungs, mostly in the left. He’s stable and his numbers are improving, the doctors are amazed. I give the good news to Bryan and tell him to keep on fighting and that I will be here when he wakes up. 

Saturday 12/8: Bryan’s left lung continues to improve with his right lung lagging behind. He’s still on the vent but he’s finally taking big deep breaths on his own. Today is my last day with Bryan, sadly I have to return to work. I write him a letter for his mom to give him when he’s awake and oriented. I say my goodbyes to Bryan, his mom and to all the staff that have been taking care of Bryan. I make it home that night and lay in bed and sob, hopeful that he’s going to pull through but I just miss him so much. 

Sunday 12/9: I’m on the airplane heading back to Hawaii, not thrilled but I know life goes on. I’m praying and believing that I will see him again. The plan is to have money put aside so when I get the call that he’s awake and stable I can be on the first flight back home. I can’t wait for that day. 


So yea, up until this point I’ve never been fully committed or really knew what love meant. I don’t believe anymore that there’s a set schedule or time line for how and when you fall in love. I just know that Bryan and I have a connection that’s undeniable and that there’s probably a reason behind the timing we met.  For the first time in a very long time I’m ready to give up my gypsy ways to have a chance at love. ",love,1544376312,notmyaccount1987,0,1,True,2018-12-09
106,So....,"Last year i finally came through a 3 year long relationship with a girl i used to think was the love of my life. It totally destroyed me and felt desperate. 3 months later started university where i met this girl with who i found myself safe to express my feelings about my last relationship. She helped me a lot and made me feel confident again. We were best friends and we still are. Unfortunately i started creating feelings for her but never told anything because she was in a long distance relationship which even though it was not going well i respected a lot. So months passed and she broke up. Through this time i told her a couple of time i liked her a lot. I thought it was the right time to express my real feelings. She actually was very happy about that and told me she loves me too. I was very happy until a week ago she said to me she still loves her ex and did not want to be with me anymore. She wanted to have the same friendship we used to have. I silently accepted and let her go. I love her and probably i will not love anyone as much as i love her. I know it is impossible for us to get back together but my hope has not died yet. What should i do? Should i try to get over her? I do not want to lose her so do you think we can be still friends?

Almost every guy I befriend falls in love with me. I can see how it would look like I’m complaining about something others would be grateful for, but it’s really awful. 
I’ve always been a girl with lots of guy friends and few girl friends, just my character and how I was raised, I guess. However, many guys I’ve befriended, sometimes even those I’ve just been nice to, have begun to like and even fall in love with me. Including my best friend. 
I hate to hurt them and I don’t want them to feel unwanted, but I just don’t feel the same way. I don’t know what to do.

And I began to make my actions show it and I've actually verbally admitted it when we hung out and we have hung out since and I've still expressed it and she has yet to make any sign to me or one I noticed (bad with signals) that she dose or doesn't feel the same way and I dont like acting putting forth time into something I'll never returned.",love,1544401528,TheDoughBoy96-420,0,1,True,2018-12-09

114,A shattered but healing heart,"Before 2018 summer ended, i broke up with my ex a week before getting with my new ex. So the reason i broke up with my first girlfriend was because even though it wasn’t a long distance relationship, it felt like one and i felt like i was putting more attention into the relationship than she was, so before it could hit the one year anniversary i broke up with her due to us not being in tune like how we used to be and realizing that it was better for the both of us. My second girlfriend probably the girl whom ill love the most because she made me a joyous son of a gun and a low key depressed toker lol. Well she messages me after a hangout with uer older brother who is my good friend and this was a week after my break up with my first gf, but my second ex messaged me i told myself that i wasnt going to fall for her and that i was foing to take my time and not let my feelings take over. But they did and next thing you know we were a thing. She took my v-card and it was miraculous 1st: 3min 2nd: 7min 3rd: 15min, she would look at ne after and tell me i got better or i would do something stupidly funny in the middle of it such as burping in her face whilst in intercourse lol.Now though we’ve been broken up for about 3+ months now and i moves to a new state because i couldn’t bare seeing her again or being around her because every time i do i feel like my heart is deteriorating on the spot causing immense pain.

Me and a friend of mine had a brief romantic stint earlier in the year, we both had feelings but she was unsure, we agreed to go out on a date and I thought we were going to start dating properly. At the end of the date, I kinda confessed how I felt, told her that I really liked her and wanted to see her again. She then responded with ""I'm sorry, but I only see you as a friend"". It stung back then, I drank a bit when I got home and tried to forget it all.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I asked her what the reason for her rejecting me was, turns out it was because I say things too quickly, I'm in pieces at the moment. I can't believe I fucked my own chances up, her and I really meshed and I thought things were going to work out, I got my own hopes up and thought I was safe to say how I felt. I never said anything like ""I love you"", I'm not that foolish, I still regret what I said though and I'm wishing I didn't feel anything for anyone anymore, this happens too often for me. This'll probably get taken down since I don't know if it is allowed in the rules but if anyone reads this and can say anything to make me feel like less of a pathetic mess of a man than please, I'd appreciate it.",love,1544412771,prettynewlike,14,1,True,2018-12-09
116,Research paper on love.,"Hi, 

I posted a survey on this subreddit a little while back asking for survey participants to help me on my College Writing research assignment. The paper is on love, and understanding it fully. I am gonna post it here since over 100 of you nice people participated in my survey!

&amp;#x200B;

Prologue: 

I have always had a fascination with philosophy. I have spent countless hours reading, and talking about it. One philosophical concept that I have always had trouble grappling is love. To me, it seems that love and philosophy go hand in hand. You cannot fully describe an abstract concept like love without a vast understanding of philosophy. For me, love has always been some kind of mystery. I find it hard to fall in love and stay in love for a long period of time. I wanted to take the opportunity to research something that I did not understand myself. I think that will give me the opportunity to create a completely unbiased research paper that comes to a genuine conclusion. I want to understand the general definition of love that most people have and compare it to a complex philosophical definition. I think that if I can fully understand both of these definitions I will find a realistic, and accurate conceptualization of love. Another thing that I would like to do some research on is the effect that psychedelic compounds have on people, and how those experiences affect their perceptions of love. Based on my survey there is a strong correlation between psychedelic experiences, and full, complex, spiritual perspectives on love. I find that very interesting and would like to get some first-hand accounts on the lessons that people have learned about love via these substances. 

Exploring the mystery that is love

‘Love is desire for the perpetual possession of the good.’ (Plato, 1951, p. 86)

Love is the foundation and purpose for almost every living conscious being. It is a huge part of everyone's life no matter who you are. It is an amazingly complex concept, and it is not easy to understand. That is why I chose to learn as much as I could about it. I want to combine the average understanding, and philosophical understanding together to create a full definition of love that I can understand. “Every heart sings a song, incomplete until another heart whispers back”(Plato). Plato, among other philosophers and critical thinkers, had a lot to say on the matter. Throughout my research, I read a lot of scholarly philosophical articles, and dialogues. I also conducted a survey with over 100 participants on love and their understanding and relationship to the idea. It gave me a lot of insight into the common understanding of love, and some of the factors that contribute to each individuals understanding. It is easier to understand the philosophy of love if you tie it to one of the best philosophers of all time. 

Plato, in my opinion, the best philosopher of all time. He was born around 428 B.C. Plato was a part of the noble Athenian lineage on both his mother’s and father’s side. Ariston his father died when Plato was young. Precitone, his mother soon married the politician Pyrilampes. Plato was a follower and student of Socrates since his early adolescence. After Socrates killed himself Plato spent 12 years traveling Sicily, southern Italy, and Egypt. He studied with Pythagoras during this time. Plato returned from his journey back to Athens at the age of 40. After he returned he founded his philosophical school. He became a teacher. Most of his works were written during his time as a teacher at his school The Academy. Plato's dialogues are divided into early, middle, and late, although they do not follow a linear timeline they are organized based on the themes in his writings. His early dialogues focused on ideas and presumptions. These works led to Plato's theory of forms. The theory of forms talks about the standard by which people judge. Like the blueprint for how things are supposed to be. The middle dialogues focus on Plato's own ideas and understandings. The Symposium and The Republic were written during this time. The late works dove deeper into theories that Plato had written previously. This is where Plato's pure theory of the Republic stems from. The conclusion that the best form of consciousness is a combination of experience, history, and wisdom. Plato died in 428 B.C. But he left an amazing legacy. Being regarded as the best Greek philosopher. His school kept on going for a very long time after he died, nearly three centuries. Many amazing philosophers studied there, the most notable was Aristotle (“Plato” www.history.com/topics/ancient-history/plato.). The Academy was the setting for philosophy in Greece.

The Academy was in Athens. It was originally a public garden. It was in a suburban area surrounded by a wall, and it had a bunch of statues, temples, plane trees, and olive trees. Plato taught philosophy there and he also wrote many of his most famous dialogues during his time teaching. Plato would meet with other scholars in a small grove and give lectures, and seminars as his teaching methods. It was an amazing place for Greek philosophy to grow and flourish. Aristotle got to study and teach there for a long time. It was brimming with genius and paving the future of philosophy. It was more of a group of intellectuals rather than a traditional school. It was where Plato perfected his philosophy. After The academy ended it became a gymnasium for the citizens of Athens. It was an excellent place for smarties to share and teach their passion for philosophy. It gave many people the opportunity to learn, share their philosophical ideas. It was during one of the best times in history (“Go Inside Plato's Famous Academy in Athens.” [www.thoughtco.com/all-about-platos-famous-academy-112520](http://www.thoughtco.com/all-about-platos-famous-academy-112520)).

387 is when Plato opened up The Academy. During this time Philip of Macedon had full control over Greece after defeating Athens. This was a time of great philosophy. During this time wealthy aristocrats had heavy influence in Greece. They controlled the government and owned slaves. Most of these slaves were poor people. This was the golden age of Athens. Soon after Socrates had fathered philosophy. There were artists, doctors, play writes, and philosophers all sharing the creative endeavors with the world. It was a time of creation and innovation in every facet of life. Although it was the golden age that does not mean it was not a time of war. Athens was involved in many different battles. They had been fighting the Spartans during this time period. I think that all of the creation could be a reflection on people trying to escape, and understand the trying war-filled times. Plato, Socrates, and his other intellectual academic partners worked hard during this time on their philosophy. It seemed important for them to understand the world, and what was happening around them. Plato wrote some political dialogues such as The Republic that detailed some of the events that were happening around him. It was truly an amazing period of time that shaped the future of medicine, philosophy, art, plays, and other creative processes for the future (“Athens” www.ancient.eu/Athens/)

Love too many is a mystery. But it seems like everyone has some personal definition and relationship with love. I learned a lot about these personal understandings through my research. Most of my participants understood love in a romantic setting. A common trend in my results were references of past and present relationships. There were people with both shallow and complex understandings of romantic love. One response that stood out to me was: “True love is an understanding, acceptance of and compassion for another. It is unconditional. It does not restrict the other person's freedom. It does not cause suffering, it reduces suffering. It's an experience of genuine emotional intimacy, and can happen only between emotional mature individuals.”. This response definitely captured the concept of romantic love, but to me, it is restrictive in that it only captures one form of love. Also, it restricts romantic love to “emotional mature individuals”. I believe that age does not play a role in the capacity to love another. There were some responses that captured a broader net around what love is. A good example of this type of response is: ‘Love is in everything and everyone, and we are all connected through the different ways we love. Love is complicated and it is pain and heartache but it is also beautiful and fulfilling and we need love to survive. Love is a web that connects all living things.” The two things that stood out to me in this definition were “Love is in everything and everyone” and “Love is a web that connects all living things.” These two concepts are what made me interested in understanding love at a deeper level. The idea that there is a force being applied to every conscious being gives a new perspective to life, and existence. It is both beautiful, and perplexing. It is hard to fully conceptualize, but I can understand it as a large blanket covering everyone. Whether you decide to wrap yourself in it, toss it aside, or share it with someone else is up to each individual. Based on the results in my survey I think that in general, most people do not understand love as fully as they could. To the average person, love is found in relationships, specifically romantic ones. If I were to define the average understanding of love I would say: Love is the catalyst for a romantic experience between two individuals. It brings both joy, and suffering, The average philosophical definition of love is much more complex than this one, and a lot more difficult to fully understand. 

I chose to focus on two people for my study on the philosophy of love. Plato, and Jordan Peterson. Jordan is a clinical psychologist, teacher, and an all-around expert on postmodernism. I have been following his works for a long time. He has been a huge inspiration for me to continue learning about philosophy, and psychology. Jordan Peterson based his understanding of love on the lessons he learned through parenting his three-year-old son. He speaks a lot about fragility, and the relationship it has with love. He expands to say “limitations is the precondition for being”. He explains that limits are to being as rules are to a game. Without rules and restrictions, a game wouldn’t be playable. He states that accepting limitation is love. “When you love someone, you love them in spite of or even because of there limitations”. He rounds up all of his points on love in one beautiful quote. “Love is the acceptance of the price of being”. His understanding focuses on the love between individuals. But it captures it in a simple way. That understanding and acceptance of fragility in a person is what love stems from. (Jordan Peterson “Jordan Peterson on Love” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwKUCUmrufY). 

Plato took a different approach compared to Jordan Peterson. ‘Love is desire for the perpetual possession of the good.’ (Plato, 1951, p. 86) This is one of Plato’s theories of love. It stems from the idea that the gods wounded humans due to their arrogance, splitting each human in half. We are constantly searching for our other half, not for completion, but for the search of goodness. Plato’s concept of love rests on the idea that love is inherent goodness and wholeness. He thinks that we are searching for that goodness so that we can possess it permanently. (Plato’s theory of Love: Rationality as Passion pg. 2). This theory can be expanded to encapture the effect that love has on everything. ""Since Plato believes that everything, not just human beings, strives for the attainment of some good, the entire universe seems to be continuously in love. Indeed, it is love that makes the world go round, without it nothing could exist.”(Plato’s theory of Love: Rationality as Passion pg. 2). This theory beautifully describes the entirety that is love. Love is as simple as the search for goodness, and as complex as the driving force in creation and procession across the universe. Love and immorality go hand in hand according to Plato. He interestingly explained why love is connected to procreation. “love must by its very nature be the love of immortality as well as of the Beautiful. That explains why love is associated with the reproduction of the species. Love issues into a desire to procreate because procreation is our nearest approach to perpetuity.” (Plato’s theory of Love: Rationality as Passion pg. 3). This is interesting to me. I had not thought about the relationship that love and sex have. I used to think of sex as a way to physically express love to another person. But according to Plato, it is evidence for the human love of immortality. Through reproduction in a sense, immortality is obtained. ‘So the philosopher, in constant companionship with the divine order of the world, will reproduce that order in his soul and, so far as man can, become godlike; though here, as elsewhere, there will be scope for detraction.”(Plato, 1941, p. 208). There is much more to Plato’s understanding of love. In general, he defines love as the inherent search and perpetual possession of goodness. Learning about Plato’s perspective on love was enlightening. He sees love through a wide lens. Capturing it as something divine, a celestial force acting on everyone and everything to create the world and universe as we see it. But what exactly is it that made Plato understand love in this way? Or what is it that defines love to each individual? 

I often wonder what exactly it is that makes people understand love. It seems that we are all born with some understanding. But what is that that allows people to see love in a negative or positive light? And what is it that allows certain individuals like Plato to understand love on a universal scale? At first, I created a survey asking questions about past relationships, parental marital status and other external factors that I thought would contribute to understandings of love. But I did not see any correlation. For most people love is trust, pain, and joy. Regardless of their past. You could asses each individuals childhood, looking into things like cycles of abuse, but I do not think those things affect an individuals understanding of love. Rather those things affect how people act in relationships with other. The only thing that I notice affecting understandings of love was whether or not a person has had psychedelic experiences. The responses that were the most insightful, complete, and complicated were from respondents with these experiences. This shows the effect that spirituality has on understanding love. Plato referenced the soul a lot in his explanations of love. I think that certain psychedelic substances like DMT, in particular, have a way of reconnection individuals with there souls in an interesting way that gives them a better understanding of love, and the role that it plays in our universe. There is a very famous documentary on DMT that follows a study on the effect that the substance has on people It is called “DMT The Spirit Molecule. The documentary follows Dr. Rick Strassman as he conducts research on the effects that DMT has on people. ‘The chemicals of their brain, which is the organ of consciousness were being changed by DMT in such a way that they could receive information that they weren’t able to receive normally” (Dr. Rick Strassman “DMT The Spirit Molecule”). This substance has the ability to separate the mind and body in an extremely spiritual, and educational way. It has the power to teach people things about themselves and the universe in a setting that is not human. “It just rips that filtering mechanism away for a few minutes” (Dr. Dennis McKenna “DMT The Spirit Molecule”). I find this substance incredibly fascinating and I want to share some quotes from people on the lessons they learned through their experience with this substance. “This was a beautiful insight that left me in awe and took me some time afterward to integrate and accommodate it in my normal view of the world. In one vision, I was seeing like billions of dots and filaments of light that also manifested the color spectrum of white light at the same time.  They were moving through everything. I asked, “what is this light?” The ‘answer’ was that it is love, a sort of energy frequency that runs through everything. It is the basic fabric of realities. It reminded me of concepts of ‘Tao’ or ‘God’. I appreciated the true meaning of the word ‘enlightenment’! I also understood that darkness is the blocking of this light and our disconnection with it. Clear out the blockages and it will flow again naturally and without judgment.” (Gilbert Ross “10 SACRED TRUTHS I LEARNED FROM MY AYAHUASCA EXPERIENCES”). This quote enraptures the idea I wrote about previous, love is everything, it is the energy of creation. Another quote that I think shows how love connects everyone is “One commonly shared experience by people drinking Ayahuasca is entering a state of non-duality or unity consciousness. In this state, you know that separation is an illusion. All different forms of life and matter are interconnected at some basic level with the source – the universal consciousness.” (Gilbert Ross “10 SACRED TRUTHS I LEARNED FROM MY AYAHUASCA EXPERIENCES”). There are countless other lessons and experiences that DMT has given people but I think these two quotes show how it could shape perception on love in a way that is more whole and complete. It makes me wonder if Philosophers like Plato were inspired by lessons learned on psychic compounds. 

During this project, I did a lot of research. I tried to gather information from multiple mediums. I created a survey to try and gather enough information on what factors influenced how people understand love, and what the general understanding of love was. It was an extremely useful tool for understanding the general definition of love. But it was not useful in understanding external factors that changed individual opinions on love. When looking into the philosophy of love I looked into philosophies that I had read before with a focus on Platonic love. It was a long process diving into Plato’s dialogues and trying to interrupt them, but it was definitely worth it. I tried to watch a lot of spoken philosophy, things like lectures and interviews when looking into Jordan Peterson's work. I think that a huge part of philosophy is how you express yourself when speaking about it. The way you say something is very important. I had a lot of fun revisiting old literature, and lessons I had read before and applying them to love, and my understanding of it. It was a long process but I think I did a good job gathering information on the complexities of love. And I believe I have a much deeper understanding of the concept now.   
  It has been a long journey researching love, and trying to understand it fully. But I think through all my research and the lessons I have learned from great thinkers like Plato and Jordan Peterson I have come to my own conclusions about love. To me love is everything, it is neither here nor there, it is. It is the force that ties the universe together, and the energy that allows it to grow. It is immortality, truth, and acceptance. Love is divine, celestial, and to complex for any human to fully comprehend. Love to individual people is the search for inherent goodness, it isn’t just found in a romantic partner it is found in every facet of life. It fuels interest, progression, art, music, anything beautiful. It is what makes you get out of bed, feed your dog, kiss your wife, etc… It is everything inherently good in the world. 

Love is.

Epilogue:

I learned a lot writing this paper. I can honestly say that it is the piece of writing I am the proudest of. I learned that writing can be a lot of fun when you are writing about something you think anyone will benefit from reading. It was hard to capture love in a research paper. It was definitely an aggressive goal to fully define love for myself in such a short period of time, but I think that I did the best that I could. It was an amazing opportunity to learn about something very important, and I am glad that I followed through. I think that the lessons I learned about love while writing this paper will stay with me for the rest of my life. The idea that there is an external omnipresent force promoting inherent goodness throughout the universe is extremely comforting. I hope that you learned something reading this as well.

Fast forward towards the prom he ends up taking some girl to prom. During after prom and graduation he tried to talk to me but I was still upset at him for not asking me to prom so I gave him the cold shoulder. Fast foward to fall semester this year and everytime we've seen eachother he doesn't say anything he just stares. For example one he went to go hold the door for me so I said thank you but he never said anything he just looked. Then there are times when he acts as if I'm not there. Is he still upset with me?

----------------------------

Death and Decay circle overhead my garden.

A pair of buzzards, looming;

Here to pick off any semblance of life.

Nothing seems to work…not compost, nor fertilizer.

What should be colourful, luscious and, lively 

Stands dull, dead and, dying.

I don't make any more attempts to revive it.

I seldom visit my garden.

My plants are frail and ache with a thirst;

They are no longer cared for.

A thick, dark fog of despair creeps up to my garden.

The days become shorter.

One slowly bleeding into the next.

In the center of my garden

An Ethereal flower emerges out of the cold earth.

A Lily.

Colours unlike no other; bright and full of life.

Perfection.

I must protect it. 

I water it every day. 

I visit my garden multiple times now.

Grey soon turns to Green

The pair scavengers are nowhere to be seen.

No longer do they circle overhead; 

There is nothing for them here.

128,Understanding that life is short to carry any hatred.,"Like any other living organism on Earth, humans do have a life span. Most probably around 70 to 100 years. The introduction of the concept of money into human life and our struggle to earn it constructs each phase of life today. 

We have seamlessly adopted ourselves into the mould that the society has been following since many years. Just think of how selfish mankind has been on Earth destroying and dominating almost all the species of life on this awesome planet just because of the so called 6th sense that is inborn in us. Not just that we ourselves have been divided by country, region, religion, language, cast and what not. We do not go hand in hand with any other fellow human being. We execute business and dump properties which we probably are not going to carry along when its time for us to leave. 

The planet is a gift that has been gifted by nature not only to us but to each living species on Earth. Be kind enough to leave what your planet gave you. Dear mankind! Remember that all you’ve got is a maximum of 100 years, spread love and positive energy till your last day.

132,"My story of romance, sex, fate and connection with someone I’ve not seen in 2 years.","Thanks for taking the time to read my thoughts and hopefully sharing yours :)

A couple of years ago I found myself single and pretty horny. My answer to this was to message a random girl I thought looked hot online. So I did, and we started talking loads. We had a tonne of stuff in common. She was a vegan like me. She was into camper vans and spent long periods travelling in them like I do. She had huskies and loved dogs like I do. Very family orientated. Lives nearby. Etc etc. 

So we decided to meet up. 

We met up, got on really well, got drunk, had sex and both went home the next day after staying in a hotel (unintentionally, as we both missed the last train home). The sex was amazing too. She was into everything I’m into, even more so than me. I thought this fetish was always going to be something girls would never want to try with me, but we did all that weird shit the first time we had sex. The FIRST time. Both orgasmed multiple times and were completely comfortable too. She even woke me up at 4am for more sex. It’s like I was in a porn video. Or a wet dream. 

Anyway, we carried on talking loads for the next week or so, finding out more and more about each other. The next time we met up I went and stayed at her house and met her family. They were all absolutely mental, but I loved them. She had 5 huskies and her mum had bipolar, so she was really welcoming and chatty with me. 

I spent a few days with this wonderful girl at her crazy house, having more sex, doing stuff you don’t usually do until you’re 3 years deep into a relationship. I remember her telling me her jeans were soaked through because she was looking at me getting horny. Just from looking at me?! So yeah, we hung out, did ‘couple’ things. I met her friends. Took her dogs for walks. Went to her favourite bar. Ate food together. Sang karaoke. Danced. She even sucked me off in a club toilet. Happy days.

When we first met she told me she was going to travel around Australia for a month, which sounded incredible to me. I was so excited for her. And so that time came and she was gone, then ended up staying out there coming up to 2 years. I haven’t seen her since. We naturally stopped talking due to distance and life getting in the way, etc. However, whenever we do talk we fully understand each other and still have so much in common. It’s never awkward chat either, it’s just hours of continuous comfortable talking between two people who once bought joy to each other’s lives for a short period of time. She often confides in me too.

She’s coming back to the UK in February and we’re going to meet up and talk and spend time together. She said she’s going to avoid most people she knew when she lived here, but said she can’t wait to spend time with me. She’s lived in a yoga retreat, travelled around the entirety of Aus, had a boyfriend, a girlfriend, saw one of her friends die, and even done one of those 10 day silent meditation things. She’s lived a crazy few years. 

I feel connected to her in the strangest way. And she’s told me multiple times i’m a huge part of her thoughts a lot of the time, even though I’ve lived my own happy life back in the UK without her. She even messaged me yesterday randomly saying she’s looking forward to seeing me right after I was laying in bed thinking about seeing her. Completely out of the blue. It’s like our brains are connected. 

Has anyone else ever had a deep connection with someone like I have with her? I think it’s something so hard to put into words. It feels like your brain and soul are connected to another person on a different level. I don’t think it’s love, so maybe it’s just an unexplainable connection. Like she knows me and I know her somehow. And whenever I’m thinking about her she’s thinking about me. Like we were supposed to meet and know each other and speak.

It feels like fate that I messaged her of all the millions of girls in the world. Fate that we share the same morals and sexual fetishes (mine are quite obscure lol). Fate that she lives close to me. Fate that she’s exactly what i’m attracted to in a girl and vice versa. She came into my life for a specific reason and I’m excited to discover why.  

I’d love to hear some of your stories about people you’re connected to but haven’t figured out why yet.

133,I found the love of my life and I’m only 17.,"I found the love of my life and I’m only 17. 

I know what you may be thinking. “You’re so young, I doubt you found your true soulmate!”. Well, I am here to tell you otherwise, if you even were thinking that. In late 2016, I met an absolutely amazing young woman who truly brightens my world every time I look at her. She just has one of those smiles that makes your heart flutter every time you see it. It instantly makes me want to smile, even when I’m upset or angry. She has these gorgeous grey-blue eyes, when our eyes meet it’s hard to look away. If I had to describe them lucidly, imagine looking into a galaxy, plentiful of stars and planets. She’s the most beautiful person in the whole world to me, and I think she’s so perfect and sexy as hell. 

For some background, when I met her, she was in a lousy relationship. She was emotionally abused, and possibly even cheated on. It all ended explosively, and I knew I had to step up and help her. It honestly astonished me how such a wonderful, sweet, kind, caring person gets treated absolutely horribly. Seeing this, I vowed to never be like him. I thought to myself, if I ever get a chance with this girl, I’ll show her what true love is like. 

Fast forward to March 3rd, 2017. I gathered the courage to ask her out after we’ve been talking for a while. She said yes, and that day was among one of the best days of my life. Things went (and still are going) amazingly. Sure, we’ve had our ups and downs. We have our emotional breakdowns and mental blowups. But no matter what she does or what happens, I will still love her and want to support her through everything. Also, something important to mention, we are long distance and have been since we met. We’ve been together (at the time of writing this) for over a year and 9 months. We have physically met up 4 times, and each time was better and more fun than the last. 

This girl is absolutely everything I’ve ever desired. Before I even met her, I laid out what I wanted. I laid out my ideas of the most perfect dream girlfriend. Lo and behold, I met her. She’s just got one of those laughs that make your heart beat faster, that make you feel true happiness and joy. Her affection and hugs make me more happy than anything in the world, besides her of course. It’s just so fucking crazy to know and tell myself that I’m dating my crush, my best friend, and ultimately, my soulmate. When I’m with her, I feel like myself. I feel like I can easily, comfortably, and happily be my nerdy and goofy self. She makes me feel like the luckiest guy ever.

I feel like we are connected by soul. We’re so intimately, romantically, and deeply binded, nothing will ever break the bond. She is my first serious relationship, and I am her third relationship. But I think it’s safe to say that those numbers will never go up. We both lost our virginities to each other, as well. I love this girl, so fucking much. I want to keep giving her my all. I want to keep doing my best to make her happy and feel loved. When you read this, please know you’re perfect. Please know I’m gonna do everything I can to make sure you’re happy, and that you know what real love is. Please know I’m gonna love you and stay committed to you until I die.

Anyways, that’s all I’ve got. Thanks for reading my walls of text r/love. And to my future wife, I thoroughly hope you enjoyed reading this. I love you so much.

136,"[Happy Vent] Something good happened today, not great, but good.","I've been queasy the past few weeks about this guy at my high school. We're both in 12th grade and we've known each other since last year, maybe even earlier, idk for sure. Until recently, we never really talked much. Especially after the last day of school last semester. That day he asked for my phone number, then a dew days later we were talking and he asked me if I'm freaky in bed and I overreacted before I knew what kind of guy he was. He just got out of a relationship and he's a man-whore (hits on every female acquaintance within his vision in one day), but it's not something too bad to where I'm absolutely disgusted by it. It's just a joke between me, him, and three of our other friends at this point. I told one of these friends when we got back to school this semester and she said that's just him, he messes around with girls a lot.

Within the course of a little more than a week, he's started flirting with me a bit more. The first time we were fooling around and I forgot what I said but in response he just said (in a joking manner) ""Shut up before I dick you down.""I laughed of course because everything 18+ or just really fucking gruesome I'll laugh at instead of being surprised. Then last Thursday, I was walking with my friend to the student parking lot and he coincidentally was on his way there. He talked to my friend like 15 feet away where I couldn't hear them as we were walking to her car. Then when we got to the car, I got in the passenger's seat and he said ""Can I sit in your lap?"" I said yes cause why not, hes pretty cute. He sat and then 1 minute later, he was still there and I grabbed an ass cheek and said ""Nice ass you got here."" He laughed and then grabbed the bit of my ass that was hanging off my seat and said I have a nice one too. Then last weekend I unblocked his number after I blocked it when he asked be the question about being freaky. I asked whose number it was just to make sure and it was his. Today, in third period, as a joke about the car thing, he came up in my ear, reached over, grabbed my left thigh and said I had a nice ass again. I laughed. On the way out, I grabbed one of his, then on the way to class, after this major event I'm about to describe, he grabbed it again. It's just been a series of ass-grabbing and sexual jokes that we both laugh at. I think for people close enough, something like this would be normal, but I'm such an introvert and damn near antisocial and I overreact to the smallest things and laughing is my first response to everything lol.

Yesterday I was contemplating how I would do it \*if\* I did it, and concluded that I wouldn't, but ended up doing it anyway. I asked him if he liked me. He said yeah, a little bit, which was more than enough for me. I thought shit was gonna hit the fan but it was actually a good outcome for my first somewhat love confession. He asked me if I liked him back and I said yeah, nodded, and did the so-so hand tilt motion. He then said if there weren't so many fake girls at our school that spread rumors like wildfire, he might actually be interested in dating me. Prime example of why he said we can't and I agree: Right after this conversation, a pan-sexual friend of ours came up to me and said people are spreading rumors about her and her current relationship. Also, I don't fuck with man-whores. Too risky. We're probably just gonna keep flirting with each other and that's as far as it's gonna get. Worst case, if rumors start, I think we'd just drift off and stop talking to each other like we were in August.

I know I'm gonna be forever alone, but I feel proud of myself that I finally mustered the courage to actually ask someone a question like this. It was worth it.

**TLDR:** I asked a guy I flirt with a lot if he likes me and he said yes and I told him I like him back but we aren't dating but that's perfectly fine because I expected so much worse.",love,1544485534,_ichigosgigai_,1,1,True,2018-12-10

138,I know we won't end up together - but that's okay.,"Ever since you came into my life, I've learnt more about myself and embraced who I am more than I ever thought I could. For the first time, there's someone in my life who doesn't just *accept* all my weird flaws - but embraces them as a part of me. I've always been ashamed of who I am, and in many ways I still am -- but through you I've come to at least accept that I'm deserving of love.

I'm falling in love with you.

I'll admit it; it hurts to know that I won't get the chance to know if you could feel the same. We don't have much time together now, and I'd rather not disrupt what we have over something that we'd have to drop in a few months, anyway. I'd rather not try and ruffle up your life - hell, I know you're not single. Even if the relationship's gone all luke-warm, I know it's not worth asking that of you.

And, honestly? I'm okay with that.

I'm never going to know what it's like to have you hold me, or to wake up next to you in the morning - to be the first and last person you think of in the day. That's not what we need each other to be.

Instead, we've committed to growing together - to working out our flaws, to becoming more than we are. There's a certain kind of intimacy that comes from recognising each other for what we actually are, not who we pretend to be, and I'm glad that we're starting to share that with each other. 

Even if we're not together, you've made me feel more welcome and more accepted than anyone else have has. You've shared your hopes and your dreams - why you have them and what you're going to do. I've shared my crisises and my follies, and the hurt that keeps me up at night. We've shared enough shitty movies, cheap alcohol, and nights rambling about how the world works that I think I'm someone special for you.

I won't ever be your partner, but I can be a real friend.

That's enough for me.",love,1544487174,shieldneedsshining,7,1,True,2018-12-10
139,Letter to my GF,"Hi babe,

I know it can be difficult talking about the tough stuff, but I'm going through some mental pain and didn't want you to get the wrong impression about my attitude or feelings. I want to get this out to you and thought this letter would be easier. Foremost, I love you with my whole heart. You are an absolute champion with your ability to refill my emotional cup. In return, I desire to be the man that you deserve. 

Like many men, I suffer mentally from time to time. My entire life I've been working to beat it. The suffering used to lasts weeks to months and definitely contributed to past relationship failures. Now I can beat it in days, but I still worry it still takes a toll on us both. Way more often than not I'm very confident and happy, but these things still creep up and I have to fight it. It comes in the form of a very negative voice in my head, telling me awful things. This voice appeared on Thrs night, and I have no idea why. This time the voice was saying, “she's lost interest in you.” I fought it back on Friday and getting out of the house on Friday night helped. But on Saturday morning and my very poorly timed relay of a musing earned a snap back from you and the voice reared, “Seeeeee you fucking asshole” I spiraled with shame. I was fighting it back by Saturday afternoon, but that little fucker just sat there laughing at me the rest of the weekend. This morning that voice kept me awake for many pre-dawn hours torturing me. I couldn't get up this morning because I was already emotionally exhausted. I'm back to fighting and determined as always to make it go away again. This is what it feels like sometimes. My heart, my eyes, my body, my mind all feel physically heavier when I go thru this. 

I want you to know this because you are the most important person to me. I dont want you getting the wrong impression. I also dont want to be a burden on you. You endured a mentally unhealthily guy before and I know you want stability now. I promise this voice will not cause me to lash out at you like he did, this voice only wants to hurt me. To make me doubt myself and us. 

I dont really know where I'm going with this. Ummmm I dont want to be another “project” for you, but you can help me in small ways to fight this voice. Compliments are not powerful enough, but something as simple as you wrapping your arms around my neck and hugging me like you mean it is like you giving the middle finger to that voice. Actions of love puts that voice in its place, like Hermione to that bitch-ass Malfoy. And you're really good at showing love. 

We can talk about it or not talk about it. I'm sorry for dumping this on you. But it helps me to get it out to someone and I wanted you to know that I have tremendous love, respect, and admiration for you.

After failed attempts at loving another individual, I've decided that my 'love conquest' will be placed on hiatus -- perhaps permanently. I've experienced - what I would call - true love once; a long while ago. I've attempted relationships after and I always end things due to my inabilities to manage time, cold-feet, etc. Relationships haven't worked out for me thus far: my first love ripped me in half, my last relationship overdosed in my parking lot. I'm now focusing on expanding my knowledge. I want to unveil answers to questions long asked; I want to leave the world a better place than when I entered it; as much as I love the idea and process of love, it must disappear from my hierarchical totem for now.

155,Can you fall in love with someone who has never existed? (Not talking about 2d girls),"So, I have specific musical anhedonia. That means, I don't understand music. It doesn't get my heart pumping like other people. However, I really always wanted to enjoy music like others. But any time I tried listening to something, I didn't feel anything. 

Today, I thought about listening to sparkle, from Radwimps. I have listened to it before: music videos and in the movie Kimi no Nawa (again, never felt a flutter in my heart). However, when the song started, and the main lead started the first verse, I thought about losing her. And I cried.

I have never been in love with a real person. I have been infatuated before, but I decided that is not what I want. Everybody has some standards and expectations from their partner. My conditions were only for it to be love. Not sexual. Not something that would dry out if we stop enjoying sex (Not saying that I don't want/like to have sex. Sex would be okay but should not be the main point of my relationship).

My whole life, I was reserved and didn't talk to people much. However, when I had a sister, I realised what it meant to love. She is the only person in front of whom I act like I do when I am alone. I thought I had three friends, but two of them are in the same high school and are drifting away. There is only one who has stuck with me since kindergarten. Even though he has a completely different stream, he is fucking A-grade and I don't need any more friends. However, Even in front of him, I can't be the stupid self that I am (tbh my stupid self acts like a creep sometimes). There always a thin layer of a mask.

I have arguments with my family, even though I am grateful for what they have done for me. Sometimes, at nights, I want somebody to understand me, to hold me. Sometimes, I feel lonely. Usually I am fine with being alone by my self, I enjoy it. But sometimes. So maybe I created this mental image of somebody who understands me. Who exists secretly in the blankets and hugs me while I am sleeping. Keeps me company. I don't think of her consciously often. I don't talk to her when I am alone. But my brain had unknowingly created such a person. And when I thought about losing her today, I completely broke down. I realised that when I usually was going to break down, she would be there usually. Giving me strength. But in today's context, I had lost her. So I was crying like a baby.

**Questioner:** What is the difference between love of illusion and real love?

**Dadashri:** The moth hovers around the flame and sacrifices its life in it. That is called love of illusion, whereas real love will last. There is no illusion in real love.

**Life of false attachment is useless.** It is equivalent to being blind. It is like a blind man who wanders around like the moth and gets consumed in the process. **Love on the other hand is constant and it gives lifelong happiness. It does not seek instant gratification.**

**Therefore, all these are false attachments of illusionary love. Everything is an illusion. Love of illusion is simply open strokes of deceit.**",love,1544537073,DadaBhagwan,1,1,True,2018-12-11

This post is dedicated to the love of my life, Suzy.  I write in parts to express my experience and love for her, and for one to know my story and have her read this and know that I love her with all my heart.  Suzy, a serene, glorious woman, A tall, glowing dark woman, She had beautiful big eyes and long heavenly hair and a voice of an angel.

Part 1 (Meeting)

Thanks to the will of the almighty, I happened to come across her post on an anonymous app called ""Whisper"". The post read, ""....wanting to know a scorpion, as I read somewhere that they're the most compatible with my sign, Pisces, 29 and above. 

I am a scorpio born on the 10th of November 1995, I was 21 in 2017. I went ahead and texted her saying, ""I am a scorpio, not 29, but I'm into older women"" at the the time I was just wanting to know women from the app. She replied saying, you assumed 3 things about me, that I'm a woman, that I'm 29, and something else, I can't seem to remember, but with that, our conversation on that anonymous started. We spoke about alot of things. Within a few hours, she was comfortable enough to share her information with me to which I said she shouldn't do so to someone from the internet. She chuckled and said she felt like she could trust me. 

We first added eachother on Facebook, I saw her for the first time, though a picture, her beauty was as elaborate as in person. We eventually got talking on Kik, and eventually exchanged numbers. We spoke about alot of about ourselves and we grew fond of each other without us making an effort. The first time I met her, I was playing a Brunch, and had invited her to it. That day when I saw here, her smile made made me feel at peace, when we first met it was a glorious experience. She liked me for who I was, was extremely fond me, we matched wavelengths even if we were 8 years apart, after the brunch I walked her out of the venue, and I kissed her on the forehead, as it was what she wanted mentioned on text before we met. She was a wonderful human, I loved how she smelt, extremely hygienic and had the feet of a puppy. I love small feet, her shoe size was a 4 1/2. She was extremely happy when she had just what I loved. After that day, I was fond of her with all my heart. I started to develop genuine feeling of love for her, from the root of my heart. I genuinely loved her. On the Christmas Eve of the year 2016, I told her I want to show her how I want to and can love. 
To which she acknowledged and for three days straight, I treated her with all the love I had for in my heart, I felt true in expressing all I had for her as a person she was. I loved her, said things from heart just the way I felt, She was overwhelmed and enjoyed what I had for her. On the end of the 3rd day we decided to do the break up the right way and we enacted the scene of a break up, all in jest. We were still going to talk to each other. A week after that she confessed that she wants me to love her more like I did. I, without doubt, told her that I will love her until time let's me, as I know I can't have her forever, but I I shall give my fullest until it lasts.  That's how our journey of extreme appreciation of each other started, and we were head over heels for eachother.

165,Why is love so difficult?,"Love seems as fake as a lightsaber from Star Wars or the time traveling DeLorean from Back to the Future. As you can see I’m a movie geek.

Sure I believe everyone else can find love. It just seems like it’s not for me. It seems easy for them. Correct me if I’m wrong. All they need to do is flirt with someone they find attractive, ask them on a date, get to know them. If everything goes well they become a couple in a relationship. Oh and I’m sure sex is introduced somewhere in there. In a successful relationship love feels their heart and yada yada yada if it remains successful they get married. Yeah I know, we all knew that already. What if there are people that don’t get past some of those steps or don’t even get past the flirting? To be more specific never experiencing love? Most of us have a loving family, but I’m talking about loving someone outside our family, not related to you.  

Why is love so important to me? I enjoy my alone time. I enjoy getting to do what I want when I want to. Seeing how love makes other people feel, makes me want to see what the big deal is. When I see a attractive woman my heart and mind go crazy because it just wants to feel that happy feeling that love seems to give everyone. Like from that movie Johnny Mnemonic, I wish there was a way to plug in some type of USB port from my head to her head just to get past all the nervousness, forgetting to say something and all the fear that goes with dating.  But even if we connect there’s still that issue that I have just want my alone time and only needing love when I need it. I don’t want to start a relationship if I’d feel uncomfortable because wouldn’t need her all the time. That’s why I’ve decided to just remain alone. Oh and sex isn’t that much of a big deal to me. I mean I like it, it’s just not the only thing I want. I care more about love. 

So my question is.. Why is love so difficult? ..For some of us, or is it just me?",love,1544568114,movieEnjoyer,11,1,True,2018-12-11

167,So There's This Man.....and an update,"A few days ago I wrote a poem about a man.
About how he was to leave for deployment in one week.
He came home last night with news.
They called him up to leave five days early.
So now he's left.
Just like that.
I tried not to cry in front of him, he doesn't need the extra stress.
He doesn't need to feel guilty for going.
It isn't his fault that his job is so unpredictable. 
I don't blame him one bit.
I am SO proud of him, for doing a job many can't.
I cry anyway despite my best efforts,
Because I miss him already.
He goes a lot, but this time is different.
Longer.
Our short times together are worth far more than the time we spend apart.
He is worth every minute, every ""hello"", every ""see you soon"".
What we have together is worth more than any distance.
And just like always, 
I will wait for this man.
He is my everything.
And I know he misses me as much as I miss him.

168,Flipping why do I love someone who treated me like trash? Whats wrong with me?," Why am I so madly in love with someone who treated me like a nothing? Dumped me in a text out of the blue, then played with my heart abit then decided he didn't want me, ghosted and blocked me from everything and I've never heard from him since. He would never answer a text or call or give me any explanation. Why do I love him so much even though I see his profiles on singles websites looking for another relationship which just reminds me that he couldn't have thought I was good enough, he couldn't have been in love with me at all like he said he was, My heart breaks everytime I look as his picture, my heart still aches for him but he hates me as he's treated me like a nothing, like I'm not even worthy for him to say sorry for the nasty present he left me or for hurting me so bad, or even a phone call. He's made me feel like I'm a piece of crap and yet I still yearn for him, why I have no idea, it makes no sense at all, how can I love someone who would trample on me like that? He's been so unkind and made me feel like i'm a nobody but for some unknown reason I can't forget him. I keep getting asked out on dates lately, but all I want his him. I can't understand myself, why am I like this? You'd think all I went through in my past with my abusive, cheating ex husband I would never want someone who could be so mean and cruel but for some reason I feel such a connection to him beyond anything I understand and i'm totally in love with him.

169,Should I tell him I love him first?,"I’m 20f and I’ve met someone (25m) who has made me the happiest I’ve ever been. We’ve been dating for 3 months and I honestly did not know that reaching this level of joy was possible...I can’t even describe in words the high I’m feeling.

I truly believe I love him, I have never loved before, and neither has he. This has been such a journey. I just love his smile and his voice and his sexy laugh. I love him. I really do. I’m actually crying tears of joy just writing this. He reminds me how beautiful the world is, he is my ray of sunshine. Oh my gosh. 

I’m just afraid that if I tell him, it might freak him out, given that he’s never been in love and what if he doesn’t love me yet? I mean, he calls me “my love” and says things like “it’s the love I have for you, you deserve my love” etc. but what if those are things that he says casually and doesn’t mean in that way? What if he feels I’m coming on too strong? Should I wait for him to say it or should I just burst out with my feelings already.

173,(M-mid 20s) On the brink of losing a 4-year relationship that means everything to me.,"You know you've found the girl of your dreams when you wake up in the morning and she's the first thing you think about. When something happens during the course of your day and she's the first one you think to tell. When you get invited out for social gatherings, and whatever else, and occasionally you go, but it's with reluctance because you'd both rather be at home cuddling and just being in each other's company. When your conversations don't even have to be about anything in particular; you don't have to think about what you're saying, or if your sentence even comes out in English. It just flows. As naturally as a stream of water running through a creek. 

You know you've found the girl of your dreams when you want to be a better man, for her. When you want to work even harder on yourself, trying to amend your own character defects, for her. When you can envision your future together, and starting a family together. When her happiness becomes your happiness, and when you realize that you've never been more vulnerable to anyone in your entire life.

You know you've found the girl of your dreams when her smile can literally take you from the deepest depths of depression to being elevated beyond the highest levels of ecstasy. When a life without her in it is one you simply cannot see yourself living. 

You know you've found the girl of your dreams when she goes away and you feel half empty, like a part of your soul is absent from your body. When with each other's support and encouragement you feel like you can take on the world: 2 vs 7.2 billion. 

Being in a relationship is about giving unconditionally. That goes for all non-materialistic values: love, time, acceptance, gratitude, and respect. And it's about doing those things without the notion that you're going to get something in return. It's the willingness of both persons to give all of themselves to each other.

That's flourishment. 

That's committment. 

That's love. 

And yet... 
Sometimes it's not enough.  
This one hits hard.  
You can give all of yourself to someone but it might not be what they need to be happy.    

You can describe what love means to you and use every word in the dictionary, but these words have very little effect compared to the POWER that the feeling of love will demonstrate.     

I write these words here now because I don't have the guts to post them on to a social media platform with my face attached, but I still want people to provide any insights they have on what love means to them. I will share these words to the woman I love in the hopes that they will resonate with her and be positively impactful.   

I'm going to fight for the woman I love. I'm still not entirely sure what that means for me right now. Some things need to change, and I hope that I find the wisdom to figure out what those things are.

Yes, you read those ages correctly, and before you call me a creep or a pervert, which would actually be against the rules, please hear me out.

I work with a lot of teenagers, being as fry cook at a fast food chicken restaurant. I do not choose to socialize with anyone of that age group, rather they choose to socialize with me. I, being a human being, socialize back.

Now, to the girl. I’m calling her a “girl”, for sake of argument. She also chose to socialize with me. She is rather “over-friendly” towards me in Way that may be alarming. It’s not exactly flirting or anything of the sexual nature.

She is a little touchy sometimes, in a playful sense, I suppose. She will “boop” me or pat me at random times. She will even want to hug me on many occasions.

She also gave me a nickname. My name is Rhett, so she calls me “Rhettakins”, adding the “akins”, like Veronica in the Archie comics or on “Riverdale”.

She has even drawn me pictures.

On one occasion, she wrote herself a note that said she was amazing and signed my name to it.

I know this sounds more like a story about a girl I think has a crush on me, than about one I may be in love with. That’s why I think I may be more in love with the attention she gives me. She always talks to me every shift on which we work together, telling me about her day, or talking about music, movies or TV shows we both like.

She has told me that she loves me on a few occasions. I guess no one has ever cared for me they way she does.

I guess I’m really wanting to know what I should do about it. I don’t want to hurt her feelings or anything. She seems to be a very fragile person, very smart, but also somewhat sad and emotional. ",love,1544679585,rcdavison01,0,1,True,2018-12-13
191,[DISCUSSION] Love is a Choice.,"You can be in love at anytime in a relationship (5 days or 5 years), because it's as simple as deciding to love someone unconditionally, every day.

So many people confuse love with infatuation. Infatuation lasts longer than people care to realise. It clouds logic, reason, and pragmatism because none of that is romantic.

Romance is a feeling that has to be created. Many people complain about romance dying out, without asking themselves what they did to keep it. Does that mean the love is gone? Well, only if you decide it is.

Being in love and loving someone are the same. Just different tenses. In love is currently. It's up to you in that moment to decide how you feel about a person. To love someone is a feat. You have to realize what you're admitting to. You ALREADY deciding that now, before, and later, you will love this person, knowing that there may be things to challenge that. 

Most people break this promise without knowing it. A clash or quarrel happens and they forget their commitment. They, in the midst of conflicting emotions, break their ""oath.""

Obviously, severe personality clashes, toxic behavior, and such things are also possible factors, but this is speaking in hypotheticals.

Love can look like many different things, but iti'll never stop being a decision that you make...or don't. ",love,1544679970,Bojacklyn,10,1,True,2018-12-13

197,Entangled,"  

I began a portentous journey so many years ago, the content of which I could not discern. An ethereal notion of its import would occur to me from time to time and yet any tangible token of its nature would escape me. Time has always teased me and as a phantom ball to a puppy I’d scamper out to find nothing. 

Recently, owing to considerable time spent within and a beginner’s knowledge of trust I have finally begun to see what has eluded me all the while.  And as it turns out, it is you my love. You have created an awareness within myself I thought not possible. It seems I have a capacity for true love and for that I am as overwhelmed as my depth of feeling for you. I have no expectation of you, only gratitude for allowing me to experience for the first time what unequivocal and unconditional signify.

It's really hard, isn't it? And it's only to get tougher ahead and things are only going to get worse. But, that doesn't mean it's going to get a lot better after that. Brightest days occur only after darkest nights.

Imagine you as someone trying to dive and touch the deepest point they can in a single breath. You went in and came back almost dead. But, you are more alive than ever.

You just endured something you never imagined you could. You just pushed your limit a little further than before. You just made memories for your future self to look upon and push past. You just made your past self proud for achieving what she couldn't.

You barely survived but, you somehow did. The water is ice cold and your blood warmer than ever in your veins, your breath bigger than ever, your cry when you are out of water louder than ever. You are alive then you ever were. More alive than normally being alive.

So, cheer up and smile. Take a deep breath, dive back in and reach a new deep. Swim back up and barely survive. Be more alive than before. Be proud of that.

And when you need a break or when you pass out pushing yourself, I will be there ready to jump in even if you have just told me to fuck off. I might not have the safest hands but, they will always be around. 😁",love,1544777102,rexcelsior,2,1,True,2018-12-14

214,Are you sure?,"""He loves me in his own way"", when I heard those words for the first time I didn't give much of a thought to it. I thought no matter what someone is, they are capable of both giving and recieving love in their own ways. I've also heard that, love sometimes could drive someone to do some things that may end up hurting the one they love, cause love makes you blind. Some say, if you love someone you should be able to let them go for their good. Some say, if you love them you should never let go. They say they love someone crazily.

Really though? I don't think love is that complicated. I don't think love needs any defending.

I think you probably are confusing yourself between love and obssession. I might be going little be towards extreme when I call it obssession but, it's close.

Love is beautiful! Love makes you happy, unknowingly, just by one thought, it makes you sad, devastated at the slightest hint of discomfort that they might have. Your heart skips a beat when you see a text. It stops beating for a second when you see them. Love makes you care more, it gives a meaning to your meaningless life, it makes you responsible, it makes you want to be a better person. Love gives you the peace. Yes, it sounds poetic, but it really is. When you love someone you get this unexplainable satisfaction by seeing them happy. It's impossible to knowingly hurt someone you love, no matter how bad you feel, no matter what they have done or said. You can't go and start yelling at someone you love because you are mad at them, no matter how much. You'll fail, cause the moment you see them or hear the sound of their voice, you're done. You'll feel helpless in expressing your anger.

But, unfortunately, with love, comes obsession, feeling of being entitled to certain things. With love you get used to their existance around you. Love brings expectations, a sense of happiness that has only one origin, the person you love. You start enjoying their attention. This is obsession. You start dong things that you were never  supposed to do, just to keep them, and you start expecting that they'll do the same for you. You get obsessed with making them happy, only because you don't want to lose them. You start living in this constant fear of losing them, you can't imagine your life without them. It's this obsession that makes you go crazy, not love.

If ""you love him"", you can never lose that love. You really are only afraid of letting go off that sense of entitlement. There's no need to get over love, you need to get over the feeling of belonging to someone or them belonging to you.

Love is beautiful !

I got out of a three year relationship almost a year ago and although I initiated the break up, this guy felt perfect in so many ways. 

I’m supposed to go to grad school starting January and the way this schooling is and considering the career path I’ve chosen (it’s very time consuming and also makes you an anal person haha) I just feel hopeless about finding someone worthwhile. 

Other times I feel stupid for caring about something like this because I’ve done well for myself acadademically, am very close to my family,have made amazing friends, and love working out and it feels so primitive to worry about not ever finding my “happily ever after.” I guess I’m here to vent and also see if anyone has been in a similar situation that has any insight on how to not give a fuck about this kind of stuff. 

I’ve been on some dates with some really cool guys but nothing felt “right” or really got me excited except one guy. But he’s kind of iffy.  He’ll text me himself everyday for weeks and have long drawn out convos and we’ll hang out every weekend for a month (mostly him initiating). and then he pulled the slow fade. I’m obviously going to call him out on it next time he reaches out to me.

239,Letters to my Ex's,"To F: My first love - you made the hopeless romantic in me hopeful. You made me believe in soulmates, in love, and made me fantasize of a future where we could and would grow old together swaying in those cliche rocking chairs as the world passes us by. Most importantly, you believed in me when I didn't believe in myself. And for all of that, I owe you much more than what I could ever give you. Unfortunately, we were forced to part ways with nothing but mutual love and understanding between the both of us as the breakup happened. Before we said our final goodbyes, I told you all I wanted from you is for you to be happy. I meant it. I still do. I know you're happy now and I can't wait to see you again. Do I still love you? Honestly, I don't know. I locked those feelings up tight and buried it deep in my heart, expecting that one day it'll be eroded away and lost to the sands of time. All I know is that I would love to one day have my best friend back. 

&amp;#x200B;

To A: You were a best friend to me when I didn't have many real friends to talk to. I fell for you because you were strong, independent, smart, and beautiful. It took two weeks of dating you before your mask started to fall. You showed me the side of you that you refused to show anyone else - one that had anxiety attacks so bad you didn't know how to breathe. I didn't think any less of you for it and helped you as much as I could. I skipped parties and hangouts to be there when you needed me. I didn't think any less of you when your hair started falling out, or when you put me down about my weight. What I DID mind was you talking shit about my everyone, especially my friends. You put me down for dating you 3 months after F and said you'd be heartbroken if I did that to you. Ironically enough, you hooked up with your coworker the same day you broke up with me. I'm sure you were thinking about my feelings then? I don't regret being with you. We had a wonderful two years together. You made me happy and I enjoyed being with you. Perhaps I should have ran for the hills when you told me you didn't know how to care for people emotionally, just physically. Perhaps I should have bolted when you tried to break up the first time because you thought your mental health issues were holding me back. Instead, I creased those wrinkles and stretched the relationship to the 2.5 year mark, until you suddenly broke up with me because it ""was best for both of us"". You told me that my sudden depression was too much for you. You decided you couldn't be there for me even though I was getting therapy. I was there for you for years and you chose to abandon me within a month of my depression confession. The real kick in the gut was when you ended our conversation by telling me that when I'm happy again I should come find you. There's a reason why I don't keep in contact with you like I do with F. Oh and if you think I don't know about your sexcapades post-breakup (having sex with every guy you told me that flirted with you), I sure as hell do. To my surprise, when I heard all about it, I didn't feel a thing. Being so far removed from the relationship now, I can finally admit that, even though I was content with you, that I was infatuated with you for a time, I don't think I was ever in love with you. Not like I was with F. Why? It's simple, you were selfish. I thought I could change that in you, but I learned my lesson the hard way. Honestly, I do hope you find happiness to commemorate the girl I dated for the first two years. However, I also wouldn't mind never seeing you again. 

&amp;#x200B;

To me: It's been 8 months. You've lost 25 pounds since A. You never worked on your style because you thought you were too fat to deserve it. Just a few weeks ago, you completely leveled up your wardrobe. You're looking better than ever. More importantly, you feel better than ever. The depression lingers, but it's overshadowed by the love and support you receive from your family, friends, colleagues and a solid blueprint for the future. Now just work on that confidence and build up your self-esteem. Don't worry about dating for now. Work on watering your own garden. Become the guy that not only the girl of your dreams has fantasized about, but you've also wished you could one day become.

242,What is falling for someone?,"What really is falling for someone?

&amp;#x200B;

Preface: A food for thought small work about the entire construct of what relationships can mean. Sorry for any grammatical errors. 

&amp;#x200B;

The idea of falling for someone (or “love”, which is easier to write than what was previously stated) is almost a foreign idea sometimes. Maybe it is because no one has ever reciprocated it in the ways that I’ve always expected it to be. Perhaps it is more that everyone has their own idea about what love really is. To myself, it has always revolved around the idea of true friendship. Someone you can do anything with and enjoy the company of each other. To quote the movie Pulp Fiction, you can share a silence with someone and enjoy it.  Something where you would do anything for that person, even if it meant to lay your own life down for them (in the “extreme cases” of actual true love). How do you know you actually like someone though (beyond actually just wanting to spend time with them)? When you find someone that you think you love but then they leave your life, it hurts. After time though, it heals and you no longer feel that way. Therefore, was that ever really love to begin with? If you truly liked that person, would you really ever be okay with them completely being removed from your life. At first when a “break up” occurs, you really aren’t comfortable with that as you may want them back. After some time though, you begin to feel different. Is that yourself tricking your mind into thinking you don’t like that person anymore or is it a realization that you never liked that person to begin with? Is either of the two a healthy option for yourself anyways?

That being said, is it sometimes even worth going after people in the sense of relationships. Some people need them for emotional reasons (that may not be healthy but it’s understandable). Some people go for them for a more physical reason (which to each their own I guess, but not something I see as a truthfully a relationship). Is real actual love just so different that you would just know that you are in it? Even so, is that something that can just be forgotten in time as well? It seems so depressing, the idea of pushing people so far away that you are able to forget them and feel nothing (especially after something more serious). Maybe I’m just different for my age group in terms of this, but it seems I only feel this way. I was always told I was more mature for my age, though I don’t act it all the time. I’ve been in many situations where I have “cut” people from my life (friends, family, and people I had fallen for). Each time, it hurts-sometimes worse than the past. It begs the question in my mind, “is this one of the true instincts of the human condition?”. I realize it’s a really depressing way to think about people in general and that love and relationships can be a huge positive in people’s lives. Therefore, is it worth the pain of when you know someone doesn’t like you but you go for them anyways? 

Pain (as in something ending between people) seems like such a huge piece of being a human being. It happens in so many ways; like through a break up, a death of someone you care about, or even someone moving so far away that you just grow apart. Is that pain something we really need so that we can grow? If so, is that growth just there to prepare us for this happening again in the future? Life seems so cyclical, basing off the idea that history never repeats, but often rhymes. Are all people somewhat sadistic in a way that they might put themselves in a position that holsters the probability of pain?

243,"I did fall for him, as or not as planned or predicted.","Anyway five years ago I walked into an elevator with a rather modest perhaps even boring gentleman in a shirt and slacks. What a boring guy. To rub it in, he introduce himself in his Rollie chair by making me turn around from my first day of work and say hi to him formally and professionally followed by him flashing me his ring. My instinctual ""pfft"" scanning-responding eyes went from his talking rectangular face which made me want to roll my eyes and turn away because he's standing his ground and I'm not falling for this stupid move, right, and finally something interesting is actually happening in my life for once, to actually seeing his fisted idiot wedding or engagement band or whatever. Not to mention they just legalized gay marriage two weeks ago and it's the hottest summer in over a decade. My heart dropped as my eyes had just been stolen and apparently so had my heart! I never want to see him again! Ran out after him making dumb useless small talk with me a few times after that and never came back to that attempted job. Love? Maybe not. This was five years ago now and I still never feel this strongly about anyone else. I think I am selfish, but I can't help it. I tried reaching out to him to let him know how I feel and cure my sickness once and for all less than a year ago while at work and just to let him know that he is loved and such and was stopped shortly by the nice boss who made sense of my rationale immediately. I feel like my life is a lie. I try to date and have feelings for other men but it just doesn't happen as passionately and the chemistry will never be the same! Goo goo, ga ga.

There's this guy and he's really cute and popular and is the first guy which is bviously into me but I'm so insecure I refuse to believe it.

Anytime I'm like maybe you do like him I just think...well your fat and ugly so there is no way in hell he's into you and I forget about it. 

What my question is is how are are you ment to figure out weather you like someone or not? Like we have known each other for a year and never thought anything of it so it's not love at first sight. I feel like if you love someone you should know right? 
I feel maybe I just am into him because he's the first guy into me
Also I don't see us together in the future at all so should I stop flirting and messaging him?

***

I ate chicken with you a few days ago
with your wrists scarred

Everytime you wipe your mouth
The deep scar showed itself inside your shirt 

In your house
There's liquor instead of water
Night instead of spring
And me instead of the one you loved

After a long silence
I asked you why you tried to die in spring

You turned your head smiling,
Asking should I die in winter

257,Dear Love,"Dear Soulmate,

Hold me. 

I don’t know where you are, who you are, what you look like, what you smell like- shit, I don’t even know if we’ve met yet, but I need you like hell right now. 

It’s 1am and I’m lonely. I long for you, your touch, and our fierce love when I lay alone in bed. I think about where you are, what you are doing, and if you’re happy. I can only imagine, for now, what it feels like to gaze into your beautiful eyes and kiss your warm lips knowing that YOU are MY person. 

Hold me my love. 

I daydream about the friends and family we will make, the life we will have, the home we share, and the time we will spend together; laughing ‘til we cry, being stupid silly together, walking on the beach at the waters edge playfully kicking the ocean to each other, hiking in the mountains with our big beefy dogs, cross country road trips jamming out the radio and stopping to enjoy the view, and fantastical getaways to explore the beauty of this world together. 

I look forward to our long deep conversations, our nights out, our nights in, our kisses, our cuddles, holding your hand, the way you call me Babe and squeeze my body when you hug me from behind, resting my head on your chest to listen to your heart beat while you play with my hair and rub my shoulders, making out while I sit on your lap, turning you on and feeling your heavy breath against my skin, the toe curling seeeeex, watching you make that face you make when your food is SOOO GOOD, singing to you, meme wars and talking mad shit, chillin’ hard while splitting a blunt at sunset or beneath the stars, and sharing the covers just to steal your body heat. 

We love that we both love country music despite all that hate we get for it. We’re passionate about having fun, being active, food, SCUBA, helping animals, the environment, working towards a better future, and puns- especially bad ones. 

We celebrate our success- victories big and small, and we support each other in failure, sorrow, and loss. We are a solid team. 

I love you, and I love us together. 

Hold me my love. Hold me hard. 

Because on nights like this, when I’m alone in the dark, I need you... and I don’t even know who you are. 

Patiently Yours, 

Soulmate",love,1545004896,allofthekittycatswag,3,1,True,2018-12-16

264,"When you truly love someone, you won't give a crap about her / his ideology.","I loved a girl for the past 4 years, since we started high school. She never loved me back, but I wasn't willing to give up on her at all. It has been one year since we las saw each other. We were good friends most of the time, but she never hit me up to talk on social media / whatsapp. I was the only one. When we finished school, I knew that I wasn't see her again. Leaving that last party was painful to me. It REALLY was, because we weren't talking. 

We talked a couple of times via messages during the first half of the year, but then the elections came. And she deleted me from her friends list on facebook. I didn't try to fix things this time, this last time. Why? Because I love her, and it was her decision. I don't care if she votes on X or Y, I care about moments, and the person itself. But looks like she didn't think that way towards me, and even if it's hard to swallow, I have to. I can't do anything anyways. 

That's human nature. That's how human relations are volatile. She's in a relationship right now too, and yeah, I might be dumb, but at least I enjoyed my time with her while it lasted. If I had the opportunity to do this all over again, I would. 

Anyways, just throwing some stuff around. Sometimes the missing hits me really hard. I was used to see her and talk to, personally, for 5 days a week, and now I suddenly have 0 contact.

267,Wishful Love,"  I love her.

The way she talks. The way she brightens whatever room she’s in. How she makes me feel safe. Feelings of security and comfort run through my mind whenever I’m with her. With her, I feel as though I can take on the whole world. But that’s the problem.  

I don’t know if I’m in love with *her* or the *feelings* she gives me.

Those feelings power me through the day. Before her, I felt overwhelmed by my loneliness. I never felt whole, like a puzzle missing half its pieces. With her, the picture of a happy life is complete. But I don’t think I ever loved her. I couldn’t even tell you what she likes to do when she’s not with me. She’s the one putting effort into our relationship, even though I don’t put much in. She deserves better. But I can’t let her go.

I don’t love her. I love the feelings she gives me.

Her presence fights the loneliness I feel. Her sleeping in the same bed as me keeps me sane most nights. Without the feelings she gives me, I’d be a broken mess. Am I just that pathetic? So pathetic that I string a girl along, so I don’t feel lonely?

I don’t care for her. I crave the feelings she gives me.

I lose that person because I was weak, I'm no longer interesting, no longer the ""man"" she needs, no longer the forever we talked about.

I remembered reading from somewhere about how we humans crave 3 types of stimulations, namely, the social (friends, family, etc), intellectual (challenging job, studies, tasks) and romantic (love, sex) stimulations. Maybe I don't have many people in my life, she will become the source of all 3 of the stimulations, I don't want to put that type of pressure on her. I had relationships that fell apart, it felt like I died inside, I was denied every stimulation and had to act as if nothing happened, life goes on. I want to be that successful man that's happy alone before finding her. Before that happens, I'm afraid to love, if I'm never fully happy myself, I shouldn't love.

278,First time meeting his best girl-friend,"Hey there! So quick background story.
After 2 years of being single, I finally found a funny, affectionate, smart and thoughtful guy. 
I’m not big on dating and would often talk with guys at a bar when I’m there but I guess you can call me a relationship person. 
Over the last while we see each other almost every second day, mix dates to museums movies bars dinners etc with just making dinner at home Netflix or gaming it out till 3am. 
He is legitimately the most affectionate guy I’ve been with (can’t stress this enough) where after the second date we hold hands 100% time, we kiss and hug and slow dance in public (gag I know I too was one of those people rolling my eyes 2 months ago) but he shows affection all the time, we have long conversations till the early mornings and he’s told me before that he’s really happy that we are together and this will lead somewhere (future talks about vacations and/or simple things like Xmas NyE plans etc) 
Tomorrow I will be meeting my new guy (we are 1.5 months in) best friend that’s female. 
He’s asked me twice before to meet his friends but both time I had legitimate plans that I couldn’t cancel so tomorrow night, us 3, are grabbing a drink after work. 
I’m 32 so I’ve done all this before but I’m kind of an anxious person in day to day life and I do really like this guy.  I’ve heard great things about her and he’s told me she’s excited to meet the girl he’s been talking about for the last while. 
*
Does anyone have any tips? 
*
I want to preface this by saying that I am an attractive woman who has guy friends that (at least on my end) I’ve never wanted or thought of sleeping with.  TBH, if worse case scenario happens ( here I go glass half empty ) that maybe they were involved ever I think I have the confidence to put it behind me ?...maybe..? 
I just know how important it is to make a good impression on friends of your partner. I love my fellow ladies and I’m excited to meet her and just want to put my best foot forward. 
(Also this Friday he will be meeting some of my friends...wonder if he will be as nervous as I am)

286,Need advice and if there is interest I’m willing to share the whole story (three years worth). Please no judging i know I’ve made my mistakes and I’m wrong i just need to ask.,"Please understand i didn’t edit this and at this moment this is how i felt and wanted the raw emotion involved. 

In 2015 I had my son and two girls at the time my own house and a successful business until the fall of 2015 i had everything i wanted. That’s when it started. A friend request on Facebook from a woman that caught my eye. Yes I’m married and never has this happened. I decided to add her and notice she had just lost her grandmother. This hits home because growing up i was very close to my grandmother so i send my condolences which leads to a response and an agreement to meet as this was platonically correct and new company sometimes helps the healing process. Well that night is a night i won’t forget. She really dressed to impress i remember being speechless something that doesn’t happen. At that moment i forgot everything i forgot i was married i forgot i had kids and i was stuck in this trance like state of thinking. That night forever changed my outlook on my current life situation and desires. She painted the perfect picture on what my life should be and from that point on i had new goals in my mind. I deserved to be handed the world on a silver platter and all of my needs and wants met as i am a king and that’s what i needed and that she was going to provide this. I confessed and explained i was married with children in which she thought i was kidding but continued to tell me that i deserve to be treated better in which i agreed. For the next month i stopped my business i stopped being home and i focused on this woman she was all i could think about. Eventually my wife found out and the constant fights grew unbearable so i spent many nights in my vehicle or in hotels and this is how i ended 2015. As i grew further away from my family i got closer to this woman and nothing could be better we took a trip to Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts visiting everything we could at the time. I had no worries. This was true love and i found it. That’s when we came back to Pennsylvania in March of 2016 and we actually get into our first fight. Long story short we were lying to one another and she wasn’t who i thought she was. My mistake at the time was letting her mother come and pick her up from the hotel we were staying at. I watch and cried from the distance as i saw her load all of her belongings into her moms mini van and drive away. I went back home and she when back with her mother. At this point i lost her and my unborn child. I lost her because she was still a secret and during this time i had to lie and make excuses for what i was doing instead of the truth. She was my world and i had lost her. That was the first time in my life i felt like death was an option. I had given up my friends, family, kids and financial stability for this woman and she had kicked me to the curb. It took a dark day and many sacrifices to win her back but i did. That’s when i realized I’d do anything for this woman. She controlled my emotions without even knowing it. I fucked up my career, i was cheated on and lied to, i missed my father's death, i abandoned my kids and allowed them to be affected mentally by all of this. Most importantly i became a criminal by conducting business the wrong way. She became my muse. She has been the only woman in my life that has been able to get into my head and shut my whole world down. She’s been able to fuck up plans and businesses with just a few words or just a mood she’d give me before I’d leave the house.I went all in and spent everything i had to give this woman the world. I gave her two beautiful children while abandoning 3 others. I never lost love for this woman and still to this day i want to make her my wife. You can’t just walk away from someone you love no matter what they’ve done or what you’ve lost. That’s unconditional love. Sacrifices are truly required for true love to strive. I’ve been in jail with this woman, I’ve seen her give birth and I’ve seen her purposely let me down and NEVER ONCE have i lost love or even question my love for her in fact it has grown. I can recall numerous occasions in which I’ve seen a change in her where she has questioned her love for me and i wonder why. Am i dumb? Am i foolish? I gave this my all and left myself in a hole i can’t dig myself out. I would still give my life for this woman without hesitation and know that it would never be the same for her. Is this why people commit suicide? Is this the battle others face every day that goes unnoticed while they sit at home or even at their jobs? How does one truly know their significant other truly loves them? Is it when they are gone? Is it when a life or death situation is at play or even their freedom on the line? When will things get better? Was it all worth it in the end? There is so much more to this and at the right time will be released. I will always love her.

287,Another year?,"You. Another year alone. Another year of only existing through these letters.  Another year of sleeping alone dreaming of you. Why can’t you be here? The more time apart from you, the larger the physical and emotional gap between us grows. I wish you understood how bizarre it is to feel like I’m losing you due to paranoia, when the reality is, I have everything in my pocket, and knowing you could come to my door right this second is open it with loving arms. It’d . erasing all confusion, all uncertainty and it’d be the greatest gift of my life. 

Still attached to everything I do, ingrained in every thought I have. For it not being enough for you to come to me after legalities lifted, troubles me deeply..  I get that it might be because I haven’t fully ‘let go’ of past, but when those fears arise these days the magnitude multiplies. 

I want you to tell me what your fears are? If one of them is that I don’t love you, you couldn’t  be farther from the truth. that hits like a deep stab in the chest for me..

Do any of your fears have to do with leaving him and that lifestyle??Did you know that the primary issue of trust and frustration is based around whatever you wanna call your relationship? How those intrusive thoughts of you two together spiral out of control?  Are you in love with both of us at the same time? I can’t be with someone who has romantic feelings for another.  I don’t believe in that. 

So here I’ll continue to work on myself and I’m not going anywhere. You are still the love of my life.

291,Translation of a famous Italian song about giving too much love,"Take a woman,tell her you love her

Write her love songs,send her roses and poems

Give her heart shapes too

Make her feel important

Give her the best of the best you've got

Try to be a tender lover

Be always near her

Resolve her troubles

And be sure she will leave you

Who is too much loved will not give back love



Take a woman,treat her bad

Make her wait you for hours

Don't show up and when you call her

Act as you do her a favor

Make her feel less important

Balance good love and cruelty

Try to be a tender lover

But out of the bed show no pity 

And then you'll see she will love you

Who less loves more love gets in return

292,Crush liked my anonymous present. What now?,Alright so I have a big crush on this girl in my class. I’ve known her for a year now and we’re pretty cool generally. She’s the only girl I’ve ever liked honestly. I try to talk to her when I can get the chance but she always is around a lot of friends and I’m naturally shy and I always have been. So one of my friends knows and he swung me a favor since we’re around Christmas time. I made a present for her and my friend gave it to her anonymously since he has a different class with her. He gave it to her and she liked it which I’m happy about. Anyways what should I do now?

294,I wish I never met her (Unrequited Love),"I've met girls in the past, but I've never felt emotions for any of them. I might have the occasional crush, of liking someone but I've never felt true ""Love"" until I met her. When people say if you wait enough, you will find the right one, and you would know it....Well, lets just say that I thought that she was going to be the one, my first love. I knew this wasn't just another crush, because I felt something deeper pulling me to her, my heart aches whenever I think of her leaving and my heart soars to new happiness when I'm around her. I knew I was in love with her when she can either make me very happy or very sad. I loved her as the person she is...

Now comes the sad and tragic part of the story. I did something that was so idiotic that I beat myself up for it all the time...I changed....for HER. At the start of the year, no one wouldve recognized the old me. When I was still going to college, I let myself go, got chubby, didn't take care of my looks, only played video games and had bad social skills. When I met her and fell in love, I thought I make a life-change and go back to how i was when I was in highschool.

I lost 30 pounds and became extremely fit, I dressed way better and took care of my looks, I stopped playing video games and went out more and developed amazing social skills where I don't even feel uncomfortable around strangers...in fact people say that I am very friendly, outgoing, attractive and interesting to be around. Heck, I even got a job as a Software Engineer and got back to school just to impress her mom that I ain't some loser. I came so close, and I've done so much for her. Even though I worked another job and went to school, I tried my best to help her out in the part-time job we both had, helping her close the store, taking emergency shifts when she calls sick, and be there when she needed someone the most. I did it out of nothing but my intense love for her. It came to nothing. 

Now she is seeing someone else. Call me egotistical but I couldn't help but find that he was basically a lesser version of me, he was average, chubby, quiet. She says she likes him because of how kind, sweet and caring he was... but wasn't I all that as well?....she just met this guy....When I heard this, I remember I cried my eyes out to her, asking her why she never gave me a chance but he did. I was hurt and I realized that i also hurt her. I was just so stressed out with my two jobs and school that this basically broke me. No matter what I did, no matter how much I tried to become a better person, she just couldn't find that spark. I had everything she wanted...but that elusive spark....even though I had that intense spark for her. All I remember that night, was my kiss in her cheek, hugging her and telling her that she is a truly wonderful person and that she should never settle for anyone less and that no matter what I would always be there for her when she truly needed it. Then I walked home, crying and depressed as shit.

Now, I just want to forget her. I truly just don't want to see her ever again. The best thing I had going was that she doesn't want to see me go...I guess I left an imprint on her. I realized that I am just another option to her. She has many options and I feel like I simply wasn't enough. Worse, a fuckboy I hate who was a former friend of mine is hanging out with her and I can't help but feel like they are messing around together. Worse, even if I cut all contact with her, quit my job, block her number....i already heard she is moving into my apartment complexes. She would literally be right next door. WHY THE FUCK....can't i just walk away from her...

I know that with the person I am now, I can easily find someone else if I tried. But my heart just won't let go and I can't find someone else until it does....Sometimes....

Wasn’t the way I would’ve wanted it to be. I was planning on telling her when we saw each other in person. But I guess I just couldn’t wait to tell her.

297,Right outside my window,"I hear your voice right outside my window.


It creeps in and butters me up


For a resonant pain twisting in the side of my head


That I'm not yours and you're not mine


My paces stepping back into that building would be a rewind of time


For to get myself to steal a thought of   lost perspective would be to share an inch of distance between you and myself all over again


In agony I contemplate why I am so weak to think this way

In helplessness I admit that you were my best friend



Transformed into the reason why I was able to fall in love with myself



And then to fall in love with you



As we all know, best friends are never truly good enough for each other when they end in separation


And ours was scattered by the shiny reflections which deem themselves stronger among closer tides. 



I cannot fight the thoughts of why I am powerless to think you may be feeling a similar way



But have many other people to currently care for



Hoping to bump into you outside that building and let you speak again so I can hook your arm around mine


I will always be the unrequited lover



Though I don't want you to fade away from my heart because you fed mine at a time when I was just beginning to control my consequences of being a woman. 


I believe what I believe and what has happened to my family is truth and history 



But meeting you was one of the most powerful things which has ever happened to me in my entire life. 



I would never ever think of you finding a reason to lose your s.o. whom you married due to our platonic encounter. 



My feelings are entirely one-sided and I'm sure if anything you feel yourself to be nothing more than my mentor. 


Though you're the one. You are. And I've accidentally told someone this in bed before and he wasn't and it was a huge mistake and I wish I could take it back low. Words don't seem to mean anything anymore. 


I love your accent. I want you to one day or perhaps more speak to me in only your native tongue I think it's the sexiest voice and dialect I have ever heard in my entire life and even five, six years later it gets me going in the morning. I remember how within those two weeks of suffering-hot in that office (coming from solely my end, of course), before I would ever get there, I would wake up in the morning and hear your excitement to see me. I dreamt you looking right at me and saying ""okay...okay?"" And then I would wake up right afterward.  Then I saw you and when you would stop me to mention some uninteresting fact about myself in the way that you did I didn't know whether I should melt, faint, or just go home and touch myself.

I put all this effort in dating, getting to know each other, learn to adjust your life to make another person fit into it, dedicate your time to the other. And still I'm left with nothing. It's frustrating really.

The thing is I feel like none of these people accepted truly who I am 100%. And it doesn't work if I can't be myself. Why though? Why is it so exhausting to completely understand one another?

Now I'm just left to wonder if I just haven't met the right person, but where the hell is he, because I really want to meet him. Or maybe I should give up and settle for the next above average person. Honestly I feel so discouraged.

Why do we even put ourselves through this? Honestly can someone tell me why I keep thinking that I still can't wait to meet my ""other half""? There's no such thing.

303,Trying to Define Love with the Triangular Theory of Love,"Robert Sternberg's Theory of Love boils down to a diagram of a triangle. At each point is an element of love and the lines connecting them represent different types of love -- perfect or ""consummate"" love being in the middle as a combination of all three. I would like to break down and analyze each aspect of the triangle in hopes that someone (myself included) will gain some insight into the foundation of love and relationships.

In no particular order, the three elements of love:

* Passion
* Intimacy
* Commitment

Passion and intimacy are very vague terms that might seem like they build off each other. Do you need passion to create intimacy? Shouldn't commitment be a given with either? Before talking about the types of love, I believe it would be beneficial to set a definition for each of the elements. Most of this will be stemming from my own personal ideas, but I will try to be unbiased, logical, and incorporate textbook definitions.

It is incredibly difficult to find an exact, objective meaning for the word **passion**. Merriam-Webster has a substantial list of definitions and my thesaurus is of very little help. But I did observe a similar theme between each description and synonym: emotion. Passion has everything to do with emotion. I don't think it can be explained as to why humans feel things...we just do. The meaning of passion simply cannot be put into a textbook set of words because passion, or, rather, the cause of passion is different and unique and subjective for each and every one of us. Why are you passionate about music? Why are you passionate about video games? Why are you passionate about cars? Even if two people are passionate about the same thing, it could be for incredibly different reasons, yet, the same powerful, overwhelming drive to spend time and thought is the product. Why are you passionate about her? Why are you passionate about him? Passion is the driving force behind a relationship. Whether it's their eyes, bubbly attitude towards life, or an inexplicable explosion of butterflies in your stomach whenever you see them, passion is what gets you out of bed (or keeps you in it) every morning.

Contrary to what you might think, **intimacy** is the glue between me and you -- not commitment. Being intimate with someone means that you know them. You're close with them. You're invested in them. But in a context of love, I think it's what the intimacy implies that's really the important part. It means that you've indulged in someone, experienced their personality, their culture, you know their quirks and kinks and outlook on life, and you still have the audacity to invest a little more...push a little further...dive a little deeper. It means that you know a person inside-out and can look at them as a perfect little mess of imperfections. Intimacy, or, rather, the product of intimacy is one of the most beautiful and important pieces to a loving relationship in my opinion.

**Commitment** is the most self-explanatory of them all. While not being the glue between me and you, it's the agreement to maintain and reapply said glue. Prior to this, I really thought that commitment was unimportant and not a true element of love. If the passion or intimacy dies out, then what's the point of being committed? I'll get into this in a bit, but let's recap and understand some principles.

* Passion is what fuels the love.
* Intimacy is what the love is for.
* Commitment is what maintains the love.
* One element can exist without the others.
* The elements have to be reciprocated between both parties.

So let's talk about the types of love that derive from these elements.

In no particular order, the types of love:

* Infatuated Love (Passion)
* Liking (Intimacy)
* Empty Love (Commitment)
* Fatuous Love (Passion+Commitment)
* Companionate (Intimacy+Commitment) 
* Romantic Love (Intimacy+Passion)
* Consummate Love (Passion+Intimacy+Commitment)

**Infatuated Love** occurs when there is only passion between two people. They don't know each other and they have no obligations to one another. I think this one of the saddest and most heartbreaking types of love. You think you found the perfect one -- it's love at first sight -- and then all the sudden they just aren't who you think they are. It's a junior high relationship.

**Liking** isn't really love. It's just when you know someone and you simply like them. Have any friends? This is the relationship you have with them. You know them, like what you know, and come back without needing to.

**Empty Love** is sad from the outside looking in. This category is reserved for arranged marriage situations where the people don't know each other, don't care about each other, but are committed and must ""maintain the glue"" for whatever reason.

**Fatuous Love** is best described as a more intense version of infatuated love. Maybe that ""love at first sight"" got blown out of proportion and suddenly you have a baby or marriage. Though you don't truly know each other, you're committed and have a drive to be with each other.

**Companionate** also really isn't love. More specific than a friend, this type of relationship is for family members. Though you know them, you might not have a drive to know them, but you're committed because you are family.

**Romantic Love** is beautiful and amazing and what I consider to be the truest form of love. You know each other. There's a drive to keep coming back. The care and concern and adoration of one another is reciprocated. You don't need commitment from a ring or verbal contract...it simply comes with the chemistry. When the passion and intimacy are flowing and prevalent each and every moment, and there's no commitment reinforcing the relationship because it simply supports itself, it is one of the most phenomenal gifts that someone could possibly acquire.

And **Consummate Love** is everything offered by romantic love with commitment supporting it. Supposedly the perfect type of love, but I, personally would argue that commitment takes away from the passion.

In closing, I would like to leave you with a quote that has been and will always be stuck with me. I would even go as far as to say that it defines ""love"". It comes from a song called ""Strangers"" by The Kinks:

""Where are you going? I don't mind. I've killed my world and I've killed my time.""

It's such a powerful statement...that you've killed your world for someone. To give up everything -- time, money, intentions, dreams, power -- just so you can dedicate yourself to another human. All you need to know is their plans and future so you can always be on standby...waiting. *I don't mind*.

308,I need advice for my Date,"Hi everyone !  


I'm going to try to be clear and short :  


\-I was living a kind of sentimentally depressed life for 2-3 years after a bad ending love story. Not looking for anything, not even trying...

  
\-I play bass in a band and 2 weeks ago, we played at one of our guitarist's friends party.

  
\-There were many girls, but as I was sick, I just planned to play and leave. But I noticed that one of them was looking at me, and a bit later in the night, she came to me and we spoke and danced and had real fun.  


\-I asked her number/messenger when I left, and I asked her to drink a glass with me on Thursday night. She said something that I wasn't expecting, like ""thank you so much for this interesting invitation"". I got really excited!  


\-Today I received a text from my guitarist, saying ""You have to know this girl is the girlfriend of our Host at the party, so it might not be a good idea to go on a date with her, if it's about friendship no problem!""  


\-I already knew that with a different version : a girl, mutual friend of ours, said nobody knew if they were still together these times... so I thought it wouldn't be a real problem.

&amp;#x200B;

  
So now, even if I know I'm doing nothing wrong, I really hate being in this situation.  
The clear thing is that I am not a ""Don Juan"" chaining adventures with girls. I am extremely rarely hitting on girls, only when I'm in a very good mood, and when the person also makes me feel good.  


Knowing this, she is 24 years old, she is a big girl, right? So if we are indeed interested in each other, it won't be ""me stealing a guy's girlfriend"", but rather her doing what she wants with her life, right?  


I have missed so many occasions in my life, I was either too shy or too lazy so many times... so this time I don't want to cancel everything just because it might hurt someone I don't even know.  


I don't have the plan to lose time, or to make anyone lose time. I don't want to hide things if something happens.  
If so, I want things to be clear directly, to everybody involved in this.  


Am I doing something wrong? Should I go, be natural and have fun with a girl (things I didn't experience for a long time...)? Or stop everything because it might make someone sad in this world?

310,10 years on the hook?,"First of all english is not my  native language but here I go.

So, like the title says 10 years ago I met this girl on  a role forum, out characters were somehow one  for each others and after that We started to talk by messenger.(you know, the old one.) back then i was a 14 teen  and she is just one year older so anyways, we get along together really well, talking almost everyday by chat for like 2 years before the fb era started here in My country.

This is the thing, we  often would talk how We are perfect  for each other, We liked each other but but... We live really far  from each others, so for all  these years she would tell me stuff like ""i love you"" and last year I asked her  to be in  a long distance relationship and she told me that she wasnt ready for that, she has no money to travel , etc. I was okey with it but she would still treat me like i was her  boyfriend, and whats making me mad  is that she's been doing this all this time, some days she would chat with me and that she would love to be with me and sometime she wont comunicate  for like weeks and then come of nowhere to say that she loves me again and stuff.

We both had relationships all those years but wd would always come again to the same spot, flirting by chat, and how great would be if we  lived in  the same city.

So, this year I moved to study music  production  and now We are 1 hour from each other, I did this on  September, just after I told her , she stopped texting me again, but i wasn't mad because that was just her way to be I guess. But then again she started again with the love you flirt stuff again and I always fall for it, like she makes me think that i have the chance to be with her and then she acts  like im no one in  her life, so anyways i take a step and tell her to finally met in person, and she agrees! Only to cancel one week before the day, and i come to think that she just wants me interested just in case, and I hate it because it works, I've been in love with her for so long that I don't mind if My chances with her are so low... 

So thats my  story, I just feel like i've been in the hook all this time, sometimes I just want to ask her if i have any chance with her but deep inside me i feel like she's just playing with me... What do you guys think?

312,[Opinions?] Should you pursue a relationship partner or let life happen?," As the title says, I'd love to know your opinions on the subject. For me, I've always found myself in relationships when I sort of least expect them, whether it's from a group of friends or Tinder. Yeah, even though it was Tinder, I installed it at half time of a game I was watching and was just planning on swiping a bit because I was bored. Ended up matching with a girl that I was in a relationship with for 3 months. So from my own experience, I prefer letting life happen, in the sense that you don't organize your free time with going out JUST to meet a girl or find a partner. In my opinion, it's better to just live out your life, doing things you enjoy, and even though that might not be a lifestyle that will help you meet women faster, I think that it will help you meet the right woman (much bigger chances of meeting a girl in a club rather than going out to play poker with friends, but I prefer the latter). So what do you think? Should you just live life how you enjoy it, no matter if the activities you do aren't exactly full of opportunities to meet women/men, or should you orient yourself towards pursuing a relationship, and going out of your way to attend parties/events at which you could meet someone?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your time!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Do you think it's better to pursue a relationship (going out of your way to attend parties/events with lots of people even if you don't feel like it) or peacefully living a life you enjoy and waiting for an interesting person to ''stumble'' into your life.",love,1545241479,SpurdoSparde28,0,1,True,2018-12-19

316,Here’s my thesis: “Real” Love is being able to be oneself without a single exception (!) and knowing that your Loved One will stay because he/she loves you for being exactly the way you are - your uncensored self. May the people of Reddit please proof this right or wrong?,"Completely honest with my partner, no secrets no things my partner doesn’t know. There is absolutely no one else on this planet, who knows my true self. My partner does. I had the strong feeling of showing her that person who I really am and I am confident about her loving this very me. 

It’s a connection that I don’t have nor ever had with any other individual in my life (m 30s). It took me three decades to find that human being that I feel confident around being who I am - and I am sure that this is love, a feeling I didn’t know existed and thus never ever felt before. 

I don’t give a shit about your opinion on me or my beliefs. So please don’t comment on such things. This is solely about if you can proof my thesis right or wrong.

I think the secret to finding true love is imagining those moments that you feel the most alive, the most happy....when you are crying cause you are laughing so hard or feeling your most proud about the work you’ve done or joy from any activity that you are most passionate about.......and then finding someone you can see doing those things with.    That really appreciate them like you do,   That would laugh at those things like you do, that would appreciate the accomplishments like you could.....that would enjoy doing those things like you would.    

We often create check boxes for who we want to be with thinking it’s those boxes that are the most important....we think those boxes are indicative of who we want to be with..... having a good job ect...but it’s those moments of clarity and genuine joy that mean more......the rest are details.   If you have true love, you can figure out the rest cause you can move mountains once you find each other.  



Just my two cents.

337,Think I have found the one,"Hi, I recently met a girl and I've never been so happy in my life. I'm writing this post more to vent a bit, ""loud think"" than to ask for some direct questions.
English is not my first language so I'm sorry for awkward sentence structure and typos, I'll just let myself loose beacuse this is so much emotions I never experienced before so expect long and emotional post.

I'm a christian, so I'll tell my story from that perspective.


In my life I'd often get a feeling in what choices to take, I trusted my so called gut feeling, but sometimes when I wouldnt expect or think about it I would get a feeling that felt so right, strong and weird almost as if someone standing aside was speaking inside my head and it would say ""that's it"" and leave me in such emotional peace that It can only be God or deep subconcious emotions. 
""That's it"" happened to me 3 times.
First was when choosing my highschool. I kinda wanted to and was expected by everyone to go to this fancy gymnasium but on the last day of choosing I got that's it feel and went to fancy technical school. I realised what I love and what job fullfills me and gives me power. I met a friend for life (and my only true friend) and a teacher that helped me develop emotionaly and moraly, he did so much for my development I could almost say he was my third parent for those few years.
Second ""that's it"" was when college rolled in, I had a 5 year plan then to get the feel, scrap most of it and decide to move out and start best tech college in the region. I gained my dream job position in biggest and oldest company in the field in the region in my first undergrad semester (job that gradues fight about) beacuse of many project I made during higschool. I developed more as a person, beacuse living away from parents and becoming your own person isn't that easy and then I met her.
My third ""that's it""  happened after her first two sentences when I first met her. 

I love the story of how we met, to keep it short, on highschool trip she spoke with a random person on the other side of the continent, later for them to meet again in college years on youth event and for me to randomly meet that random girl (she is from my hometown and The Girl is from another side of the country). So if you want to look at it with pink glasses you could say If she didn't talk to a random person in her highschool she would never have met me. 


Since then she happened to become my roomate and she openly said she was avoiding moving in into the apartment in which I live (not bcs of me, but beacuse she would be the forth roomate) but something made her move in, some weird feeling of it being right idea  (??her version of ""that's it""??)


So she is living here for a week. 
We had so many close moments it's untrue (emotional/mental way). Without effort we talk for hours and it never is about basic stuff, it's deep and it mentaly chalenges us both. We are same on the moral/mental level, we are both a bit too mature for our years and that lead to us having no friends or serious love interests. So what I wanted to say we understand each other perfectly, it's a bit uncanny how much we rly do, but on the outside we are pollar opposites. She has no college education and is a huge fitness fan, her dream job is to be a private trainer and run her own gym and it makes her happy when she works around that. Meanwhile Im a geek, I code to live and live to code, coding on challenging project and designing games in my passion and that drives me as much as fitness drives her. We dont like same food, she is vegan and I'm a huge meat eater, music, movies.... basically anything on the surface level is different. This week we spent so much time together and we were behaving like we were old married couple and not just random people who know each other for a day or two. Everything was so effortless, pure and made us both happy and by some magic however far apart we sit, we would somehow endup next to each other, having lots of physical contact without it being intentional hugging or holding. She would alaway end up on my shoulder and we would watch/talk/read. Noticing that I invited her to a dinner and she like imediately accepted and we rly talked there and I realised why I got ""that's it"" when meeting her. We share same oppinions on life, we have same life goal and we both found our motivators. 

I feel so happy when I see her, when I hear her it's hard to explain reallly, it's not that hype childish feeling I used to get when I liked a girl before, this makes me perfectly calm and in peace, it feels just right. During the day I discover 10000000000 times how beautifull she is. And I can tell you this for sure you have never seen true beauty untill you have seen a beautiful girl talk about what she loves. When she does that I.....I.... I cant put it in words, it's perfection in front of me and every piece of my body wants to make it happen for her. 


So in a week of living together we do so much small stuff for each other unconciously. We kinda automatically first fulfill needs of the other person then tend to our own matters and I find that respect and putting partners needs in front of ur own is true love. We can be alone together, we respect when one of us needs it's time (both introverted as hell), we can sit in dead silence each reading a book next to eachother for hours.

Today I left to my hometown, to spend holidays with my familiy and on parting she punched away my hand, huged me and gave me the widest purest smile I have seen, I almost shed a tear. So two weeks without her are in front of me and I don't feel needy or anything childish I used to feel in my past relationships when I'd be parting. 

From all the talking I concluded that she does like me, even more than she expected she would In such short time, but she just moved from her hometown, she just got a job, new city, new people, new everything and she would prefer not having to deal with relationships untill she takes a firmer grasp of the material situation. It was almost like she said ""Please give me time to stabilise here, and if you continue to be here for me and actually show that you live by morals you told me about I would be totally fine with you making a move ""


Can anyone say this doesent sound like The One, like the real deal, like we trully are starting to love each other? Any oppinions on the story?",love,1545352157,RedJohn31,3,1,True,2018-12-20

341,"[**UPDATE **] Falling in love with my best friend, do or do not?","Please help me understand: 

So yeah, the saga continues. After a months of not being able to read between the lines I got fed up and decided to take some distance. As much as she is one of the most important people in my life, I realized that maybe taking distance from her would ease my pain... So I stopped texting her for a month and a half, but she didn't write to me either. It was so fucking difficult. What I felt was a mix between death of a family member and the end of a love relationship. After that period I got an angry message from her telling me ugly things, including she will never trust me again... Few weeks later I sent her a message asking her to go have drink cause the last message I received from her, was hard to digest. To make a long story short: we spent 6 hours (and 2 bottles of wine) talking, during which we were holding hands (almost the entire time) caressing each other's hands, hugging and kissing each other (hands, head and cheeks but not on the lips) many times, and I ended up walking her home holding each other's waist, just like a real couple. 

You may ask me why I didn't KISS her or declare my feeling to her. 

Well, while she was doing all that and telling me that I was a part of her and she had to absolutely have me in her life,  she was also telling me that now she wants to move in with her boy friend and has plans to have a baby.... What's going on? I'm now even more confused. On one hand she makes me promis not to ever date her sister or her two best friends and on the other hand, the shtick  about her boyfriend. I don't feel comfortable to tell her what I feel cause I know 100% that she will say no. But I can't help feeling confused. Every time I'm ready to put my feeling behind, she comes back with something like this and I'm back to square one. Sometimes I feel like she wants to keep me as reserve in case things go south with the other guy. I hope by the description I give you don't imagine her to be an awful person. On the contrary, she is one of the kindest human beings I ever met in my life.

What do you guys/girls think? 

&amp;#x200B;

**Bonus story:** 

I arrived 15 minutes earlier to our meeting. While I was walking to the bar where we were supposed to meet, I saw her boyfriend hiding in a corner of 50 yards from the bar. I gave all the signs that he was there to spy on us. In fact he was supposed to be in a class. I find it funny on one hand. On the other hand I feel like his insecurities put pressure on her. At the same time I understand if anyone's girlfriend had this kind of relationship with a male friend, it could be hard for the.  

&amp;#x200B;

**\*ORIGINAL POST, 6 MONTHS AGO:**

I'm so confused that I don't even know how to write this message. Me (guy 40) and my best friend (girl 40) have been closer to each other more than anyone else ever for the last 5 years. We are both in dying relationships for over a year. None of us has said anything about our feelings to the other but the signs are so obvious that everyone around us noticed it, including our partners and even people that don't know us... For a long time I forced myself to kill these feelings cause I don't want them, not only out of respect for our partners but also I'm terrified to lose her. She has become so important to me that if nothing happens between us, I'll be happy just with the friendship. The problem is that every time (not very often) I see a clear sign of interest on her side I can't think straight.... Help me ladies I need female opinion. what should I do? do or do not?

344,Love letter to my wife,"My wife and I decided we would exchange love letters for Christmas. I decided to try to get a little creative with it. There is some insider info in there, but I think you can still get the idea. Thoughts?  

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Wife,

I should write about you more often. As you know, I have written things before. However, complete misery has generally been the source of my creative intuition for sequencing words together in a coherent series; and with all the nonsensical prestigious and pompous words I could possibly derive from an internet search engine and project in your general direction, I don’t think I could ever quite possibly convey the magnitude of blissful contentedness you have given me in life. So I’ll give it to you in numbered form: ∞. Infinity, beyond the lame and cheesy context of claiming that my love for you is eternal, is a construct with which you are probably somewhat familiar (even outside my quite incoherent ramblings on topics I know nothing about). For some thing to be truly infinite, it is greater than *any thing.* If it has **always** existed, then it will exist **forever**. If you subtract or add to it, it remains unchanged. If you have an infinite amount of space with a finite amount of matter, then the space is still empty. A void can be empty, yet still have stuff inside. A little piece of infinity. I told you that you saved me. What I have come to realize is what you saved me from. You have saved me from being swallowed by the void, and for that you have my eternal love. After all the stars in all the galaxies cease to shine, all the protons (maybe) decay into their constituents, blackholes evaporate into subatomic particles, those particles are flung apart by the rapid expansion of our universe, it's inevitable heat death, and even after our stupendous reemergence through a spontaneous entropy decrease; More than *anything*. **Forever** and **always**. While our universe may be without meaning in the infinite void of space and time, I am rather happy with this outcome as I get to spend that little piece of infinity with you.

Love,

353,After the first 3 seconds.," It was around this day last year. I saw you walking from your workstation. You smiling while glancing at the floor and found myself astounded. Shivers down my spine, goosebumps on my skin, that cold at the tips of my fingers, hearing crackling in my pumping heart then the adrenaline kicked in.

&amp;#x200B;

I knew I was scared.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I say ecstatic? I thought I was cautious and asked everyone who I knew that knows you. I said, that pale, rose cheeked girl who always wear anything white. Asking them what you were like and they said you are kind.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing but kind every time.

&amp;#x200B;

Passing days just finding myself just looking and staring at you without a thought. It was like second nature for me to look, recreate how you made me feel. I'm sorry but smile that looked that sweet and warm was and still is addicting. An image that hasn't left my mind. A simple act trembles every inch of my curiosity.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever seen I lemur on the wild? Yes, that.

&amp;#x200B;

But alas, you don't like me. Not even a little bit. Unseen messages, that effort to make it seem I wasn't there. A chance not given is a chance not wasted, right? You are kind. I was just on the wrong side of that coin.

354,"The more we see each other, the more emotional it is to look her in the eyes.","My girlfriend and I first met in August on tinder. We dated for a month before she asked for a break because she just injured her knee dancing. Fast forward to just before Halloween she wants to go on a date to catchup up. We’ve been dating ever since. 

The main thing I want to talk about is how when we are together, whether it be 2-4 times a week, neither of us are ever on our phones. When we do stuff we are just by ourselves in our own little world. No distractions. Just get to look her in her gorgeous eyes and listen to her talk. It’s majestic. We vent to each other, laugh to each other, we cry and let our frustration to each other. 

Last night we exchanged Christmas gifts as I will be out of town for almost a week and won’t see each other for a week. After we exchanged gifts she read my letter and she asked if I loved her. I said yes, she said yes back. When she asked that question she seemed like she knew the answer which made me give in and say it. 

Before that when we were laying in bed, almost nude, just laying with each other, massaging each other, rubbing on. Nothing else, just us. Again no phones, no tv on, no music, no technology. Just our bodies and voices. It’s truly beautiful to me. 

Neither of us in good situations with school, she just got injured and can’t dance, I still don’t really know what I’m doing, transferring again, just a little lost I guess. She’s been helping me calm down with it and not overreacting, I’ve been calming her down by telling her it’s only for a few months she’ll be down. We both vent to each other numerous times about our worries. We listen to each other. We sympathize for each other. We are emotionally invested in each other. 

Just looking in her eyes now compared to our first date has changed so much. There’s so much more passion when she looks at me and I look at her. It’s like when we play board games with my roommates and her best friend, we all play together but then there’s me and her and we’re playing but on another world with each other when we look at each other in the eyes. 

Idk what this really about. Just wanting to say just how beautiful it is to get to know someone and trust someone and fall in love without any distractions, no bad communication. Don’t take it for granted. When you’re with your significant other, don’t get distracted by your phone getting lit up, or be too invested in your show. Look at them. Ask them about their day. Ask how they feel. Look them in the eyes. Just the eyes. Hug and hold them. Physical contact.

358,Feelings are complicated and tangled and weird,"This will be a quite aimless and meandering post, but I wanted to get it out there.

The first boy I ever dated was also my best male friend. Like we were friend-soulmates before we ever liked each other romantically. God I can't describe our energy together. In a relationship though something didn't really spark and we went back to being friends; he then moved away this year to study abroad. 

So today I saw him again for the first time in months. Since then we've both started dating different people, but I'm in a long distance relationship and he's head over heels for his girl. Like they could actually get married, I think. It's the most perfect relationship I've ever seen. They're beautiful together.

We hung out the entire day and I laughed so much, I realized just how much I missed him, and for a second I remembered what it was like when I liked him dramatically. Obviously I love my boyfriend wholeheartedly, but nobody makes me feel as comfortable as this friend. It was just a weird feeling knowing my best friend has found someone way better for him than me (and I have too), but just a lot of nostalgia and a slight bit of  wondering ""what if"" and also a bittersweet happiness that two people could have this crazy connection, things not work out, then they're good friends to each other for the rest of their lives.

363,This love makes me grow,"I (F23) love my boyfriend  (M22) so much. We have been together for 9 months now. He is my first partner and my first love. It is like a dream. He is so soft and yet so strong. So loving and caring. Funny. Smart. I love to smother him and let myself be smothered by him. He has such a heavy place in my heart. He is all i wanted. He is the spring after the cold and hard winter.


This year was the best in my life. Especially after the crisis i have behind me... All the bad times. Especially 2017 was horrible for me. I wanted to die so much.. The only thing keeping me from it was that I didn't want to hurt anyone with my suicide. 

I had been in several clinics. I think the worst thing of the things i had was the OCD, even though i was depressed too. I was anxious, afraid and instable. I was at the bottom. And i saw people that had it even worse than me. 

And i started to heal very quickly. I grew as a person in this time and found happiness again. 
In the last clinic, the daily clinic, Ive been to, I met him. He caught my eye at the first time i saw him. Through time, it developed into a crush. And I did my best to befriend him although I was very shy. It took me a month to as for his number! .... And one day when we were already friends I asked if we wanted to date.

This love is one of the best things that happened to me. Although I discovered a lot of fears and flaws of mine i never knew before in this realationship, I worked on them with my therapist, as well as on my other problems like the OCD. 

In the latest sessions, I looked back with my therapist on everything I reached. I learned who i really am. What is most important to me and what  want in life. I know myself now so well by now. I am in a good place. I am secured and loved deeply. I am happy.

371,"Is it just luck whether you find ""the one"" at a young age?","Now to start off, I know the ""true one"" does not exist, there is not one woman/man existing that will be ""perfect"" and ""meant for you"", moreso of an idea that there is an amount of people that are extremely compatible with you, and provide the best chance of a lasting, loving, more-than-anyone-could-ask-for relationship. Although that is fantasised of immensely and rightly so, it is a very attractive philosophy. 

My question is, are there any means of trying to find your most compatible person? Or is it merely chance, and the lucky ones are spared indefinite suffering and work that the not-so-lucky ones are doomed to face, and possibly lead an unhappy, unfulfilled life because they always feel that a part of them will never be filled because they are in the wrong marriage/relationship and to many things are going wrong? And even if they do discover this compatible person, what are the chances that it will be younger than 30? I would rather find them at a younger age and live with them for so long, than discovering them with most of my life already spent. Either that or settling for something that will not last, and bearing the struggle. 

Are my ideals and expectations too unrealistic? Is this what causes people to be unmarried for years and years?

384,Should I wait for her to decide or move on?,"Hey, I'm on the crossroads and can't decide whether I should move on or hope for the best.

I met her on a dating app, 3 weeks ago. I've messaged her casually, she responded (That was quite a surprise).. After a small chat, I dare to call it like that. But it was mostly one word reactions ""Ok"" , ""Yeah"" etc. 
I bought her a gift I knew she wanted for a while. That got her attention and so we've met personally. It was a quick visit, just exchanged few words, hugged and went back home. 
She's really sweet and I love practically everything about her. Day after that she invited me over to her place, but nothing serious happened... We continued chatting, I told her about my feelings and love for her.
Second week after we met, we had a date, in our style. Took her for her first VR experience, dinner and ended up in cinema. That was when we broke the touch barrier, cuddled for the almost whole duration of the movie, but kissed just once. You know, the quick kiss, where your lips barely touch. 
We're into 3rd week, still chatting, sometimes sending kinky stuff. But she still keeps on responding with ""It's too early"", ""I don't know much about you"", ""You don't play World of Warcraft"" ... And yes.. the last .. it's a thing that matters to her quite a bit. 

Now, I know it's relatively short period of time, to decide whether you want to spend, at least some of your life with the guy or not.. 
I am more than aware of my looks too. - Just a casual PC nerd in face 😁 But in my whole life so far, I was only with one girl for 3 years, before she cheated on me. Thinking about other guys, having in my years 10+ girls.. crazy.. 
It might sound selfish, but I know I'm a really kind guy and I would do anything for her. And she knows it.

Yet here I am, thinking about giving up on her.. Anyone who could relate and give me some hints and tips?

389,Girls are complicated or is it that I can't read her at all.,"It was like straight out of a movie. 8th grade first day of the school. I was walking up the stairs and i closed my eyes. thinking my crush wouldn't have left the school and then I opened my eyes hoping she would be at the corridor but she wasn't. But there stood a girl, new to the school and somehow my mind said instantly. ""You'll have a story with her""

She wasn't so tall. Had specs on. I think that's what made he *cute* And the whole class eyes were on her. i thought maybe if i approached i had a chance but
fast forward. 
She got into a relationship with the biggest asshole of our grade. it was kinda dominant from his side. restrictions and all shit so she broke up. i was proud for the fact that she broke up with him. she made a stand for herself.

After that our school ended. we went separate ways but came in contact through fb. 
we talked and talked. and finally she was mine.
i told her about my first day story. Yes! Love at first sight!(i shit you not)
it was good. she was supportive. we rarely had any fights. we trusted each other. 
just like a normal couple. we were happy.
i was happy. Life was going great.

but
one day she broke up. no reasons. she didn't evem told me any reasons. i tried my best to get her back but she won't.
 after a year
i get to know that she is in a relationship with a new guy. i was broken. shattered. but i was positive.
i had no hatred for her. Bcz I loved her but she broke up.

Fast forward. after 3 years
college life. Everything going good and great.
i was over her and was enjoying the best moments of my life. 
Engineering Life. smoke shisha. play fifa. everyday

but fuck me 
she called me one day and told that she was not happy with her bf. fights and restrictions and shit.
and seriously she told
""the kisses we not like mine or the hugs"" with her bf.
i told her to break up with him. and foolishly i hinted to get back. together. she said. we were never meant to be together. i was like damn girl. you regret it after 3 years. i got totally angry and was raged over this shit happened. and i told ger to fuck off.
and cut the call. tears ran down vigorously.

ff. last week.

she called me again. as i saw her name on my phone.
i thought i shouldn't but i did.
it was a casual talk. nothing more nothing less.

i was in town and wanted to meet her. i called and she readily agreed. as her bf was out of town. we went to the same place we went in the past. her bf called and she panicked, she wanted to get to her home fast. but I said. you can go but I'm gonna finish what i ordered. only so that she could stay. calmly. she was being too panicked so i threw her phone into her bag. 
the dinner went. i don't know. she kept repeatedly using my name. she touched my hand once and i felt something's weird. this whole thing is weird. i could look into her eyes. i couldn't even call her name. i just couldn't. she ate from my plate. she put forward the fork having noodles in my mouth. i didn't knew what was happening. i all ended soon.

after that i dropped her off to her home.
i asked won't your parents mind if i dropped you in Front of your house. she said no. her bf comes to her home.
that was her last words. and i didn't contacted her since.

and I'm sitting here and wondering what the fuck was going in her mind. 
why the fuck this is even happening. life goes on and on. we have ups and downs. we learn to pick ourselves up and move on and go straight ahead. having hopes in our hearts that one day it'll be all right. the woes in our heart will be swept away and the storm would calm down. and we'll Live. 
but sometimes things from the past suddenly appears in front of us. and we break down like in a second. and we're back to square one. 

Don't hate someone cause he/she broke up with you. whatever might be the reason.  You loved him/her. you can do no harm to them and how could you? instead show them your Love. Kindness. Things that'll keep us sane. 

Feeling relieved after writing this shit. Thanks for reading this shit till the end. And yes Girls are complicated. For me i could not know after all what she wanted.

390,"She’s the one, but doesn’t know it.","I’ve been thinking to write this a thousand times, but now I’m finally willing to let the words and feelings flow.  I could make a throw away account, but she doesn’t use reddit.  And if she finds out, so be it. I’ll just win or lose. In worst case she’ll never talk to me again. 

About a year ago an old girlfriend of mine (10 years ago-ish) added me to Facebook.  We were together for about two years and we never ended our relationship because we hated each other or anything like that. For me it was just that I was way too young (18) to to be sure that she was the one. Also, she would go study in the university, and myself I would get into the military service for about a year, both in separate towns. Young and dumb, I/we ended it all...
Some times during this ten years I’ve been wondering what’s she’s up to, and if she remembers me. 

When she reached out to me on Facebook it was the old “hows life, what have you been up to the last years”. And we started to hang out together last for the last year, I thought nothing more of it really. But now, after close to a year after we started to hang out again, I realize that I’ve have a crush on her again.   No, not a crush,  I’m in love again.... She is the one for me, but am I the one for her? I really don’t want to loose her friendship because that I fell in love with her again, but at the same time, I can’t stand the thought of loosing any more time if she feels the same.  Because for me she is honestly the one that got away.  I know a lot of boys say this, but she really is.  She’s funny, pretty, down to earth and has an incredible smile.    
I really know why I’m writing this, and I’ll probably delete it all tomorrow anyway, but I had to tell someone, even if no one of you know me.   I’ll let her know in time, but I’ll wait a week.  New year, new beginnings they say. Let’s hope for the best!

391,The best day of my life - story of my first love.,"In March time of this year, I was feeling super depressed. I was 15, gone through first set of mock exams for GCSEs, preparing for second set of them. Stress really got to me. 

One night, I felt like I should end it all. Before doing so, I opened up Snapchat, try and add someone to maybe talk to. Came across a mutual friend, girl in year below me, school not too far from mine. She immediately adds back, and I see on her story she wanted someone to talk. So I did. Just an evening of that kept me from killing myself. I thought it go on from there. 

Ffw a few weeks and we meet for the first time. Very nice, shy and cute. We bond and everything just clicks. Go through to summer. Not seen her much due to revision and exams and also the fact she has protective parents. 16th birthday comes around and we go on a walk around where I live. Quiet and tranquil, a nice way to have spent the day.

Ffw to November/December. She's now doing mocks and stuff, so hasn't seen me since birthday. She has to study for many hours, so barely talk as well. Also I've moved school for Year 12, so I too was stressed and just needing to settle in. She's very supportative.

Now comes to the 22nd. I finally see her again, after 4 months of hiatus. It starts of awkward, because we both are like that. Eventually have the courage to have her sit on my bed with me. Decide to wrap arms around her. She doesn't back away. Then we start cuddling. Give it half an hour or so, little talking, not that we needed to nor are we good at small talk. Spur of the moment and kiss her on the cheek. Do it a few more times, she begins leaning in. Continue cuddling. Another half hour passes, occasional peck on the cheek. Proceed to go for the lips. First time, we just start laughing. Have another go, and just feel revitalised and cleansed. It was my first kiss. Then it all happens. We then just go for it. Again. Again. Again. Change the pace. Long kisses, short ones. Pure ecstasy was rushing through me. Holding each other tighter.
She had come over for 4.5 hours. 2.5-3 we spent doing this. I told her, during this, it was the best day of my life. I know I'm right, as a day later, I'm absolutely miserable that it couldn't end. I just want to relive it all again. ",love,1545610201,whatadampsquib,0,1,True,2018-12-23

394,I’m in love with a guy I stopped talking to,"I met a guy a couple of years ago that I ended up really liking. I met him through a dating site and I was really only looking for a fling at the time. We ended up sleeping together and spent a lot of weekends with each other for a few months. I told him I liked him and he told me be did too. He asked me if I would be his girl one night. I wasn’t sure if he was serious because he was drunk so I wasnt sure if I should take it seriously. I also knew he was still going out and hanging out with girls so I was scared. I would get upset with him every now and then because photos of him with girls, one in particular, would come up and I would ask him if he was seeing her. He always said no but I just wasn’t sure because I had only met his friends a few times and didn’t know any of them well enough to ask. After I stalked the girls (crazy, I know) I found out that he was seeing one of the girls more than as a friend. I got mad at him and told him we shouldn’t talk anymore. He still contacted me and I was a sucker at that point and kept talking to him and seeing him. But after that, we only saw each other every couple of weeks. That turned into maybe every month to every couple of months. It was the same story every time. He would text me or I would text him, we met up, I would see a photo on social media, get mad at him, and tell him I didn’t want to talk anymore. I did ask him if he wanted to date once and he said he wasn’t ready so I let it go. I’m just sad because I really liked the guy and I still do because I still think about him. I think that he is still seeing the other girl though. Idk if he didn’t like her very much if he was also seeing mw or what the situation is but I feel dumb for falling for him without knowing someone else was in the picture. I also feel dumb for still having feelings for him. I cut it off this last time because the girl texted him when I was with him. He texted apologizing a couple of weeks later but I haven’t seen him since. It’s hard not to talk to him and act like I’m so strong for letting him go. I didn’t know what else to do if he wasn’t going to date me after two years and was seeing someone. I know I can get another guy but I wanted him only. Now, it’s just hard knowing that he’s with someone else while I’m sad over him. ",love,1545623440,Foreverconfuzzled,0,1,True,2018-12-23

Only thing is, she smokes weed a lot and my parents know that. They're super against that stuff, and always encourage me not to hang with her because of it. I smoke a good bit too, but I'm pretty good at concealing it and they have no idea.

Although we don’t do big things together, I enjoy the small moments with him like, listening to him explain a math problem at math club, watching him play volleyball, hang around him and his friends whenever we get the chance or just talking about our near futures. We aren’t really close, but I just feel an ache in my heart when I think about him. Unfortunately, 3 of his friends told him about my crush on him and I couldn’t properly confess to him due to his tight schedule. It’s awkward between us because he doesn’t feel the same.

My hand is in yours and you’re leading me to a quiet space.

No words come out.
My hands are shaking. My knees feel weak. 
You’re coming closer.

405,She broke my heart and she was never really mine,"We met at work. Pretty much all Summer ‘16 me and her were super close and hung out all the time. Honestly, I think that’s when I fell in love with her. We just had a connection that we shared through music, conversation, and as lame as it might sound, a love for weed. We were both big potheads lol. This made us extremely good friends. August came around and we started having sex and on god I’ve never had better chemistry in bed then I did with her. But the sex was still just for fun, it never materialized into a relationship, even though most people thought we were dating. Then she left for school and she started dating a kid she’d been talking to for a little bit and we didnt talk as much but still hung out when she came home, as friends. We got less and less   close until the end of the following summer. She was having problems with Him and I told her to stick it out because shit would get better. Who am I to try and kill a relationship when I wasn’t even a thought in her head? So then I think it was Mid-October she called me real early in the morning sobbing because her and Him had broken up. Still I didn’t try anything and didn’t say anything about how I felt. So she continues on but she still would go over and hang out with him and what not and they were like kinda together kinda not. She was clearly in love with Him and he didn’t have the capacity to show love back. ~Fast forward to last week~ She started texting me, normally how we would talk as friends. Then she asked if I was doing anything later but I was super fucked up so I said I couldn’t hang. Then she said she was in a super cuddly mood. So I took a chance and said me too. We got deeper and deeper into the conversation and I worked up the nerve to tell her that I’d never stopped being attracted to her and that I was in love with her. In turn she said that she’d always had those same feelings. Monday comes and we hang out we’re making out, cuddling, having sex, the whole works. It hit like one o’clock and she took my arm off of her and when I tried to put it back she told me no, she was tired. I sat there for like 30 minutes and then got up and left. She still kissed me goodbye. She barely talked to me at all the next day and didn’t talk to me at all the day after. In my head I knew she was back with Him and it’s still tearing my heart apart. So I sent her a long message explaining why there’s no way for me to be friends or anything else with her anymore. She agreed and said she hoped we could be friends again eventually. Oh and the she added “I’m sorry if I hurt you.” No shit you did! I’ve known this girl for over 2 years and she means more to me than anyone. Now I can’t even see her because I’m in love with her and she’s still in love with Him. How could she say those things to me and turn around and go right back to Him the next day? How do you choose a toxic relationship over a pure one? How can I ever move on knowing that a piece of my heart will always be with her?

It hasn’t been long. We met only weeks ago. 

But the words came out of my mouth impulsively, while he was talking and we were laying in bed watching cartoons. Ever since meeting him everything he does and everything he says makes me fall in love. It sweeps and overwhelms my system and I had to tell him. I’ve never felt this way about anyone before. He isn’t perfect. He shares a lot of struggles with me, but the way he has dealt with and overcome things in his life makes me love him. Because I know how he felt. What he went through. How hard it was to get better. 

The way he sees the world, the way he sees me, the way he talks about his passions. He’s such a beautiful person and such a good man. He inspires me and makes me feel warm and makes me want to put good and happy things out into the world.

And yet, I can’t even scratch the surface of what this word means. Who am I? Who are you? Why should I care about you above myself? Why are you feelings and interest above my own? Is this love I feel for you? To most people, yes. Then why won’t I say it? 
Conditional love. 

I’ll love you for as long as you’ll love me back and don’t hurt me. What’s that there? 
But you love me. How can you set these reservations on me? What if I can’t keep you happy all the time? Will all this effort be in vain?
Yes.

I lost myself. I lost who I was. I lost my drive, sense of purpose. I felt like I lost it all.

Who is this? A strange, yet familiar spirit. Why do you bother? It’s a lost cause. I’m no longer who you knew. I’m the unknown. Broken but undead. Mass with no form. What do you see in me? Maybe your mind is clouded by memories. What were your intentions? Just as I was on the brink of a fate worse than death, life without love, you lit a cleansing flame inside me. A flame that not even you can put out now. A rushing river with no end, and endless waterfall. I feel it. I feel love. It’s thanks to you that I feel it. At a time where there was no love of my own, you shared some of yours with me. 

Who am I now? I’m new to this body. All I’m running on is the memories of the last recipient. I can make this work. I can make this so worthwhile. But. But. But. Butt. 

How to thank you? I’m sure you need no thanks. In fact, you don’t need anything from anyone. That fascinates me about you. I haven’t gazed at your eyes this way in a long time. I don’t need the world at my fingertips. I don’t need you. I need to love you. But to love you conditionally like every other miserable fuck on this world would be the biggest slap in existence.

I want to give you pure, raw, live unconditional love. Love that would rival God’s. Maybe it’s impossible. I’m nothing. No one. A speck of dust that can be blown away in an instant. Maybe it’ll destroy me, but I’m willing to be a living sacrifice in your honor. I’ll be a martyr, not for my beliefs, but for yours.
For what?
Love.
Why?
Because I can will it.

I love my friends and my family and my dog, I'm not a psychopath, but I just can't seem to feel romantic love anymore. I really try sometimes, I've had good people ask me out and I can see how we would make sense together, but I just can't force myself to conjure up these feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

The weird thing is that I've been in love before, and I also know people who are currently in love. I can see it on their eyes and their actions, and I remember how it felt when I was in love. But the man I loved and I grew apart, and I chose a more career-oriented path, and basically ever since I broke up with him I haven't even felt the smallest spark of love towards anyone. I'm finally coming to realize that I don't know if I'll every fall in love again, maybe it's not in the cards for me. I don't feel any need for it either, I'm a little lonely sometimes but it's nothing I can't handle. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's just a strange thing to not to really care about love. When I was a kid and a teenager, it was all I cared about.

427,Help me guys,"I love someone more than life itself.  All day long all I do is cry. Not the normal crying, I feel like someone else i love has died. Maybe it wouldn’t be this bad if you actually weren’t alive. But to know that your still here and so close to me but so far away, is more heartbreaking than words can describe.  I know he loves me, more than anyone else he’s ever loved.  Guys, I have lost the best thing to ever happen to me. How can you go on, just how? All the memories, all the love just thrown away. So many nights together in your arms, so many nights lost in your eyes. Touching you breaks me down inside.  I’ve slept so long without you, it’s tearing me apart too. The days and nights are so long. I just want it to end. But knowing if I left or made me leave this place, would hurt you so bad, and I can’t do it to you. So I’m stuck in this limbo, lost and alone in the dark without you. Your a 1000 miles away but I still feel you. God I still feel you.

428,"You are special in me, but I'm not that much in you","You were my love since the first day we met 3 years ago. We were on the same bus, looking at each other's eyes at the same time, did you notice that? When you found me on social network, I admit it, I was too excited to sleep that night. Then came the time when you get bored of me. Then came the time when you told me to leave you alone, because you hated me already. What did I do? I just wanted to give you a gift...no. You deny it. It's been 3 years, and at the time I'm typing those words out of my heart, that flower is still on the table where you left it. Do you remember? Do you know how rude were you, how sad did I became? 
You left me. You changed your place, you totally moved away. What do I have left? Nothing but memories. Yes, I totally realized how special you are. Everybody around the place know me for my talent of being attractive, being wealthy, being intelligent. But no...the same cannot be applied to you. I have NEVER seen ANYBODY like you. You are not attracted to the money, the expensive gifts. You totally don't give a shit about my power, about the strength and wellness of my whole family. You love DIY, you love art. You are yourself and artist, an admirable one at that. 
It's been 3 years. Yesterday you texted me. Saying that you missed me. You know what I did? I immediately stop all the relationships that I was having at the moment. I deleted tinder. I unfollowed models on instagram. I'm totally attracted to you. I thought about you for the whole day. But now...I'm afraid. In my whole life I was never felt so weak like this moment. I'm afraid that I will lose you. I'm afraid that I will make you hate me again.
The moment you told me you were studying at Singapore, I planned a trip to visit there this Lunar New Year. I must see you. I love you more than anything. But I can't feel any bit of it from you. Why, after everything I have done, after all of my feelings for you...
I love you, Z.

I came back and saw him February 2018, and had to end it with him because I felt I wasn’t ready to commit because I wasn’t ok with my self as well as other factors.  So I had 11 months to really focus on myself and what I wanted in life.  Recently at a party, my friend called an old “high school” crush of mine (Not the guy I’m talking about) for some reason I was excited to hear him, but when he started talking I realized how much of a douche bag he is now.  And said to myself, “Why did I like him?”.  My best friends were like “I’m glad you didn’t end up with him!” Compared to him, the other guy is 100x better and I’m so dumb to have ended it with him because not gonna lie he made me extremely happy plus I never had a boyfriend and he’s the closest one I had.

435,Why do people in movies say “I love you” so quickly? do we make too big a deal out of saying I love you?,"I’d like to discuss this because I think about it a lot. In movies, characters often profess their love for each other within weeks of knowing each other. Why do we wait so long before telling our SOs that we love them? Do we make love synonymous with a greater depth? 
I find that in platonic relationships I can tell people I love them basically as soon as I meet them. Why are romantic relationships so different?

Bonus: is love a choice? Sometimes I feel like I tell SOs I love them when I make the conscious decision to do so. Thoughts?

446,Relapse,"I used to love this girl when I was in high school a few years ago, and I loved her insanely hard which fucked with my dopamine levels really really hard for 3-4 years in the way hard drugs do by activating my reward system added to the fact that I was going through puberty and which means a whole lot of fucking unbalanced hormones. In fact I use to have dreams, like very vivid and intense dreams with her in it which only furthered this cycle. I think she loved me too because she would play footsie with me during a math class during a few weeks and we would talk on Facebook for hours. Either that or I was doing a shit job at hiding my feelings to her, which wouldn't surprising to me frankly. 

I have come to realize thought education and research that the difference between cocaine and love for me was that I was consuming that love every day for those 3-4 years until I graduated. I had her my classes for four years and saw her in my last year frequently as we had common friends.

Then I graduated and I didn't see her for 2 years until 2 years ago. It wasn't such a problem, but then I saw her at a party last year and we talked with friends and shit like normal people do at parties and I fucking relapsed, my dopamine levels went up during the next few days which led to me feeling depressed as I wouldn't see her probably ever again for a long time and maybe ever again which fucked with my brain, wanting to see her again. Then as time passes, I forgot about her and move on. Then I saw her again at a party recently and we talked a bit and indeed, it fucked with me again. In those two instances,  dreams with her came back, dreams that were again very vivid and intense, in situations where we would be in danger or at war against another country and had to flee. 

It's funny because me and my friends we aren't like heavy drinkers but we like to get waisted like any other uni student after long fucking semester but everytime she would be there, she would tell me to not drink to much, which furthered fucked with because it's showed she cared about me and people in general.

I don't know why I am publishing this really. I don't feel like I'm in love with her, I just feel like my brain is just fucking with me because of the way I loved her a few years ago which, like a drug just messed my whole dopamine system. I think love, although it can be the most wonderful thing people can experience, it can also lead to depression and dark thoughts, like self harm or suicide in the extremes. I personally experienced those self harm thoughts because I wanted to show how tough I was. 

If you are experiencing this, that you feel like you love someone very fuckkng hard and feel depressed because you don't know what to do, know that it's ok, especially as a teenager, you are going through many hormonal and cerebral changes, your dopamine levels are most likely of the chart. For me, the best thing to do (which I didn't do) is to tell that person, in her face that you love her very deeply, especially if you feel that she might love you. Or else talk to someone who you feel supports you, or a psychologist who ca  help you deal with those emotions because they are very overwhelming.

448,Should we go on?,"That was four months ago, I secretly love my current girlfriend, which was still in relationship with her ex-boyfriend. She was my colleague. And she didn't know that I like her since I merely did personal contact with her unless we have some business issues. I didn't even talk with her much on Facebook. However, I liked to attend every group activities she attended. 

I still declared to her that day because I have to go abroad to take a PhD for four years. But surprisingly, she broke up with her ex-boyfriend like three days later. She was supposed to marry him a few months later. I didn't understand why but I still felt happy and began to chase her and delayed my entry time for PhD for four months. After one and a half month, she became my girlfriend. If things go on like this, I would be fine. 

But another surprising thing happened. Last time she broke up as she was in mad with her ex-boyfriend. Her ex-boyfriend asked her come back from the US but he then decided to come to US himself and wanted her to give up her job and came with him. Then at the timing, I showed up and she also had a very good feeling about me. But she later told me that she still loved her ex-boyfriend more. And she felt she betrayed their relationship and felt extremely guilty. 

Then she broke up with me and came back to her ex-boyfriend. Another turning happened. Her ex-boyfriend knows that she was with me during this period and could not accept it, then broke with her again, only after two weeks. At that time, I was preparing to leave and she lost everything. Then she came back to me again and I forgave her. I do really love her. 

Now our relationship seems steady. From what I know, she is a good girl. But this mistake is really stupid. The sudden impulse hurt me, her ex-boyfriend and herself, only because she didn't think carefully before she did every action. But to be honest, I don't know whether we should go on. She said she has figured all things out and wanted to go through the four years with me. I trusted her because she told her mother. Her mother felt angry about her and me but still accepted fact finally. I just don't know how other people, our friends, will view us if they know everything.

We worked together for a few years and I know he had a thing for me but I screwed it up because I was pretty innocent at the time and scared that I was not good enough or he would laugh at how inexperienced I was (he's 5 years older). In retrospect, I know it was stupid. He probably thought I was a tease. He was someone who just blind sided me. I was beyond infatuated with him and intimidated by how perfect I thought he was. I could get anyone I wanted and yet this is the one person I never got because he literally took my breath away and everything that came out of my mouth was garbage. Sometimes I want to tell him how I feel but I know that would be insane and he would think I'm insane because we haven't seen each other or talked in years.  I'm with someone esle now with whom I love and he loves me very much but for some reason I've never been able to get over this one person.

I look at him and see the most beautiful creature I have ever seen. He makes me feel okay. He makes me feel like maybe not everything is bad, maybe this world really has some beautiful things and he’s one of them. And don’t get me started on his eyes. Fuck, his eyes. I wish I could just look at them for the rest of my life, but they intimidate me in so many ways. I can’t maintain eye contact with this beautiful person. Every inch of him is perfect. I never thought I could look at a person and feel all this love, my heart beats out of its place when I see him, but at the same time, it gets so peaceful and calm. He is so peaceful and calm. He is so pure. He is perfection itself. I hate being this cringey, but I don’t want to keep this to myself. He makes me so happy. He takes my soul to so many beautiful places when I’m with him. I want to be with him. The other day he said: ”don’t believe it if someone says they can’t live without you, because they can” and all I could think of is how? I don’t want to and can’t imagine my life without him. He has set the bar so high that I don’t think anyone will ever reach it, and I hope no one has to. If there really is a God, and miracles are real, please don’t take him from me. I want him with me, forever. I love him so much. I cry at the thought of him. How can someone make me fall inlove with him this way? Love is such a beautiful feeling, it heals everything, when it’s both ways. I don’t want to imagine my life without him, please. My heart breaks into pieces when I do. I want to look at him and be able to touch him all the time. His soft skin, oh my god. His skin. His hair. His cheeks. His cheeks. His cheeks. Fuck, his cheeks. I could kiss them all day long. You don’t get it when I say I have found perfection in a person. I see happiness when I look at him. My stomach does that thing where it gets a bit nervously happy. I want him next to me all the time. And that smile of his. I want to break the hands of every single person that dares to take off that smile from his face, even if it’s me. The way he looks at me. The way he walks around the kitchen when he’s making food. The way he walks around his room when he’s looking for something he misplaced. The way he fixes his mustache. The way his hand goes through his hair. The way he cuddles me in bed. The way he falls asleep between my arms. The way he puts his head on my chest. The way he kisses my hand. Please don’t take him away from me. Please. I love him. He is my life. ",love,1545871450,elenorpot,0,1,True,2018-12-26

478,"this guy I am talking to sent me this, what does this mean"," 

Some nights I stay up thinking about you. I recognize that there is so much I don’t know about you and your past. I’m not oblivious, I stay up thinking about you, I’ve had many conversations with myself, where I tell myself that I am aware of the fact that you’re hurt. I could just as easily be like most guys and decide I want to go and pick up some random girl that I feel nothing for. I think that would be a huge waste of my time. I tell myself that I know that you’re hurt, and I always remind myself of that because I have to keep it in my head that it may not be soon that you decide you’re ready to trust someone again. I don’t see that as a bad thing though, there is nothing I could have done to prevent you from being hurt, and although I wish I could have that’s the simple truth. I don’t think it would be fair for me to give up on you and invest my time elsewhere just because you’re hurt. Why should you have to pay for something that you had to go through. I don’t and have never expected anything to come from this just because I understand the position that you are in. But that doesn’t mean that I can’t care for you and be there for you. It doesn’t mean that I can’t and won’t remind you of how amazing and perfect that I think you are. You have flaws much like everyone else, but I have no trouble looking past them, its almost at they don’t even exist to me. I recognize the seed inside of you, and I don’t know if you remember the meaning behind my tattoo. The most beautiful roses only arrived to be that beautiful because someone took the time out of their day to make sure it got what it needed. No rose became beautiful without someone there to water and care for it. If I could put into the words how much I like you and care for you, despite having just met you this year I would but I simply cannot. As stupid as it may sound, I wouldn’t mind being the water that builds you up and shows you your true worth even if in the end you end up with some other guy. What matters to me is not that you give me the chance to be with you, but that I can make your days just a liiiiittle bit better. Most people do things to get something out of it, but I am perfectly fine ending up empty handed, so long as you’re happy in the end. And even then, that only scratches the surface about how I feel for you. I can’t help or control my emotions towards you even if I wanted to change them and I don’t, I can’t.",love,1545904295,ucsbgoon,2,1,True,2018-12-27

483,What is Love?,"Love is amazing. It’s painful, exciting, terrifying. 
Our story makes my heart just melt.

When I (25 f) left my ex, I moved into a small apartment by myself. I would hang out outside of the building because I just didn’t want to be alone. My friends lived in the same place and would hang out with this guy (28 m) that owns a diner right outside. I’d hang with them when I was lonely. I remember the first time we were introduced. I honestly was so caught up in my stuff that I didn’t give it much attention.

I started going outside just to see him. He was so happy, all the freaking time. Full of life. I told him every part of my life. He slowly told me some of his, but mostly we jammed out to awesome music every night. Songs started becoming messages that we were falling for each other. 

I already knew he was not interested in anything other than friends because his life was busy, and he has goals. 
He played everything so cool, I suspected he wanted to be with me but was fearful. I just enjoyed his friendship. For a year. (Huge for me because I always wanted to rush into everything)
The fair was in town and a guy ruined my trip the first go round, so he offered to take me with his employees. We had so much fun! I knew that day I was absolutely in love with him, and I could not change it. I stayed at his house the next night, and I couldn’t help but needing to be close to him. I needed to feel his love. It had been a long time coming.
He knew me pretty well and knew I would jump super ahead. He told me a few days later that he didn’t think he could give me the time I deserved because his dad was getting sick and the diner needed to be run. I was so sad but respected his care with my feelings.
I dated someone else for a month and I thought of him constantly. He was a little sad but didn’t blame me for running around.

That fling ended quickly and I started hanging around again. 
A friend of mine said to just sleep with him. At least to get over the unending need to be close to him. I just needed to know if we were just as compatible in bed. 

After a year of seeing each other almost every night as friends, we slept together for 4 months. He knew I loved him, and finally said he loved me back. Month 5 we started calling each other bf/gf. We have been madly in love ever since. 

Love is allowing the right time to happen with the right person. Love is patient and kind. Love is this man, and the way he treats me. Love is both people being full of their own insecurities and fears but allowing someone in to see who you are and why, and letting them love you. 

Holy crap I love him. I knew that night at the fair that I could happily spend the rest of my life with this guy. I hope we get that chance. I love his life, and his happiness. ",love,1545929040,thejackwagoninvasion,2,1,True,2018-12-27

486,My love letter to you,"Im am in love with you. Always have been. Its been almost 10 years since we first met. Two teenagers just trying to figure life out. When we first got to know each other i knew i shouldn't see you in a romantic way so i did my best to avoid it. We became really close best friends even. Staying up late on school nights, sharing our dreams and passions. Somewhere between all our goofy moments and serious conversations i started having feelings for you. I took the risk a few months later and got you to agree to go out with me. Short lived however as you changed your mind later that day. I was upset, still young and immature. Avoided you for a while but then we found each other again. Some reason you were more open to the idea of us or you were just trying to reciprocate the feelings.

Snuck me into your room one night. No lie i thought i would get lucky that night but i wanted something more. I wanted you exclusively. As we kissed and you told me this didn't mean anything i was just happy to get to this point. We didnt go all the way i respected you too much for that Still my heart was skipping a beat and i know you could feel it as you layed on my chest. I wanted to do things right with you. As i snuck out that morning and went home i had the biggest smile on my face. Woke up later and i could still taste you on my lips. This was when i knew i was in love. I never dared to tell you because i knew it would likely push you away. Some time passed and eventually you said you didnt want to be with me because you knew you would fall in love with me and you didn't want to. My heart shattered. I tried to accept just being your friend but just the thought of having to be there for you while you were with another guy was just unbearable. I decided to join the Marines to take control of my life. I said i couldn't be friends with you no more. At the time i knew it was for the best for me. Seeing you cry for me was bittersweet. 

I left to bootcamp and through every suffering moment i thought of you. As i was tired, hungry, scared you came to mind. As i lay outside looking at the California night sky before my final hike to become a marine i thought of you. The stars looked as beautiful as you that night. I couldn't wait to come home and meet you again. 

Once home i started getting attention and love from other women and it was nice. I let my ego and pride take over. It was nice to be wanted for once. So i got with other girls throughout the next few years. Convinced myself i was just a bit obsessed with you and i would eventually get over it just like everyone said i should. I didn't 

Years later we connected again. Thinking i had finally gotten over you i was willing to give our friendship another chance. I invited you to my last marine corps ball. You said yes. I got scared. My feelings for you crept back up. I was scared of feeling vulnerable again. I was scared of the pain. So i impulsively told you i didn't want you to go. We stopped talking that day.

Since then i was angry, at you, myself, life. I wanted to be done with you. It had been 7 years since we ""happened"" it was due time. I met another girl with a baby. She loved me. I liked her company. We ended spending two years together. Moved in together after my military duty ended. Ended up getting engaged. I stopped drinking to be the best father i could for her kid. I was committed. The entire time however i had a gut feeling it wouldn't last. No matter the effort, she could see the hidden emotions i had for another. I ended up leaving her months before our wedding. 

6 months passed and i didnt miss her. I missed you, and again i was angry. Why you?! I can get any women i wanted, be happy, have a family, but it was you that would always come to mind. No other would make my heart skip. No other gave me butterflies in my stomach like those movies say. Then it finally hit me. I truly am in love with you. It defies all logic and sanity. I shouldn't be, but i am. The concept of moving on is a road with a dead end. 

Since the day i accepted that i love you my life has turned around. I love myself more than ever. I have an amazing job, my dream car, even remodeling my mother home with plans to build my own. I am satisfied with myself and best of all I no longer am angry. No longer do i feel a hate towards my hearts circumstances. I just love you. I have yet to speak to you but i do have plans to. Come april once im all settled i will tell you how ive felt this entire time. I lived a third of my life loving you without once even looking you in the eyes and telling you. I can no longer go on like that. I know to some it sounds dumb, or it doesn't make sense but i now know that with love its not always going to. I am not expecting anything in return. In fact you could easily tell me to fuck off and that would be fine you'll never see me again but i just have to get this off my chest. 

I am happy alone, i am content with my role as a single man for the rest of his life. The fact that i got to love at all is more than enough. All is forgiven. We both were young and naive and had many mistakes to make. I just appreciate that i have all these memories with you. You may be with someone by the time i talk to you but thats okay. You deserve to be happy. Just know you will always be loved. I guess i wrote this for practice for when i see you again. 

With much love, your old friend.",love,1545934862,1047CLP,2,1,True,2018-12-27

491,I love him,"Where do I even get started. 

He is so amazing, he actually listens to me, he cares for me and is always here for me.

My anxiety was really bad when I went on a school trip alone. He was in drivers ed and he stayed on his phone to help me calm down, he said it was his last class and I shouldn’t feel bad.

He always lets me rant, no matter what it is. 

We’ve cried together. 

His personality is perfect. His and I’s humour is the same, so whenever I’m talking to him or with him is always funny. He always cheers me up. He seems like a “tough” guy but he’s such a softy at heart, he’s such a loving guy but he doesn’t show it often. I’m so happy he’s in my life. He talks about me to his friends, about how much he likes me and such (i’m friends with his friends, so they know me)

And on top of that he has amazing looks. His smile melts my heart.

Here’s the thing, I’m so in love with him but I’m 15 and so is he. 

We’ve both talked about how we don’t want a pointless high school relationship that’ll go nowhere, we talked about how we want this relationship to go out of high school. How we want to be in each others life for ideally, forever.

It’s so crazy because I am young, and this is only my second boyfriend and his first girlfriend. 

I know I’m going to be judged heavily for being in love at 15, and wanting to take this relationship out of high school but he is all that I want really. I want to go to college or university but I want to be with him while I do it. I want to be at his side during the good times and the bad.

492,A unrequited love letter.,"I do not love you as if you were salt-rose, or topaz,
or the arrow of the carnations the fire shoots off.

I love you as certain dark things are to be loved,
in secret, between the shadow and the soul.

I love you as the plant that never blooms
but carries in itself the light of hidden flowers;
thanks to your love a certain solid fragrance,
risen from the earth, lives darkly in my body.

I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where.
I love you straightforwardly, without complexities or pride; so I love you because I know no other way
than this: where I does not exist, nor you,

so close that your hand on my chest is my hand,
so close that your eyes close as I fall asleep.

When she left me, I began thinking about all the things that didn't work in our relationship. I began thinking of how I should have cut it sooner with her but didn't because she would use her depression to justify her shenanigans (and I talk about she once physically abused me)

A couple weeks after it ended, I had a drink with a female friend of mine. I was already crushing a little on her, but then she said something.

She looked at me with her soul piercing haze and said: *she did not deserve you*

You see me as such a good person, but not on a pedestal. You know I’m flawed but you see me as your little ball of sunshine and when you called me that, it really inspired me to get into a better headspace.

So I beated around the bush and eventually I kinda told her i liked her. Once she figured out, nothing changed and we were still friends like that never happened. I never got a clear cut answer of whether she liked me back or not so i just let it go bc i assumed that she'd never actually feel the same way about me..

Last week I started talkig with classmate of mine who have been in the same class for 3 years. I have fallen in love. She looks shy but is very talkative and she is in general amazing. The bad part is that I get very anxious. Up to this point, I've never been anxious about talking with girls (I have been in 2 relationships). But with her its very different. Everytime I think about her or talking to her I instantly get anxious and my heart goes crazy. How to I stop this?

7,Poem to hols,"

oh invierno vasto me sueña la esperanza de la lejanía mediocre,

no es que yo pretenda batallar contra la corriente,

pero cuando tengo convicción me enamoro de un canto de sirena

y caigo ante los enredos de la vida.

Oh Dios! cuanto deseo dejar este melifluo lastre 

cuan lejos estoy de ti!pero mi alma llama y suplica

cuanto desearía estar atento a la quietud de mi presencia 

para poder ser consciente del enredo de las ilusiones nefastas; 

en ese estado precipita una entelequia

es el surgir de la belleza.


Fue como una película
Fue de inercia y ahí estabas
Sentí que me miraste y paralizaste el tiempo
Con el viento batiendo tu pelo pelo largo y yo enamorado a mi parecer
Inmediatamente todo lo demás pierde razón de ser.


Quisiera no ponerme triste
Pero verte conmigo es un sueño que no existe
Mi corazón al compás de un colibrí que no para de aletear
Miro tus manos y me olvido de respirar
Un nudo en mi manzana que pide respuestas
Te veo y trato de decir los gestos que demuestras.


Guardo mi equipaje presuroso y te veo de reojo
Sacas el teléfono y yo como un rayo me paro y te observó de soslayo
Deseoso que notes mi presencia y el regalo que estoy por darte:
La esencia de mi ausencia.

Me voy y con cada paso me arrepiento más y más
Te extraño como no tienes idea
He quedado como océano sin viento y sin marea
Como playa sin sol y sin arena

Recordando tus besos podría morirme lento
Inmortalizando lo sublime del momento
No hay día en que no estés en mi mente
Cuánto quisiera que estés aquí presente

Desde tus últimas palabras la vida perdió su magia
El cielo es ahora espejo del pasado
Donde mis memorias recrean lo vivido a tu lado
No me basta ser valiente para olvidarte, una rosa me destroza, piso 21 y su guitarra me desgarra
Las estrellas de testigo te admiran en comunidad, 
a ellas les confieso: 
ojalá algún día Allison me de una oportunidad,
pues dentro de mi ser profundo,
ella será siempre, 
todas las primaveras del mundo.

8,b,"First and foremost i want to apologize for my inability of being honest with you, for we both can easily recognize the importance of our relationship should be built around our mutual trust...I never want you to believe that my love for you isn't sincere or authentic... That i'm just a fake. A phony who builds lies to make you believe i'm more than who i really am, B. You know all of my flaws, but more than anything, KNOW that I still deeply, deeply love you, and that apology alone barely skims the surface on how sorry i am and for what i did on the special date of yours over six months ago... that'll take a little over a lifetime for me to forgive my self for.

&amp;#x200B;

Here i am, right on the cusp of being thirty years old acting like an overly emotional scared teenager. Is it because the love i have for you is truly an intoxicating combo? Is it because i haven't seen you in over two years? we're obviously not in the best of shape right now, but do you remember when we initially discovered that profound connection we have? When i'd look at your it felt like fireworks blasting off in my chest, unable to concentrate on anything but your mouth and eyes (that would always dart away)? To now, its like were having those extreme highs and lows where my fear of losing you is fully exposed. What hurts is like when im watching it fall apart in front of my eyes. Do you think more time apart has causes more of the envy and jealousy leading to those fucking immature tantrums? Maybe as the time is going on you're disappointed with the possible outcome of our unconventional love story..Is this just reality sinking in? I used to think of it more of the story of just you, and I. I was able to push back your friend from streaming thoughts, but now, its like hes been motioned front and center and sometimes the story is more you and him (nearly identical), than you and i...and that fuckin kills me.

You need to know that in every love triangle you will HAVE to make a decision, and PLEASE. Go with your heart. Go with what its telling you. If theres anything burning inside of now, not what was, go with it. Tell me if you need more time. Even tell me if you're neutral. Again, don't believe that my love for you has fizzled. Don't tell me someones saying i don't deserve yours. I want all of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

i want you to know right now that ill go another year sleeping alone, just to have the chance of waking up next to the prettiest girl i've ever laid my eyes on. let me know if you need more time to believe in me. i love you

The big thing that is holding me back from moving on is the fact that it is so different with this girl, every other girl I have had feelings for, I’ve always had the bad gut feeling about and knew deep down things weren’t going to work out, the issue is that I know how amazing she is, but she doesn’t know it herself, which is why she can’t get over someone who is so bad to her

We talk about art, comics, what’s capturing our interest currently on Netflix, our friends, family, the experiences we’ve had and what we are looking forward to doing later on in life. We don’t miss a beat with each other, we’ve never felt like we had to say something to appease each other. We just are who we are, and it’s so beautiful you accept me as the way I am, and I you.

18,What do you make of this quote on love from Simone Weil,"""The Love of Phaedrus. He neither exercises force nor submits to it. That constitutes the only purity. Contact with the sword causes the same deﬁlement whether it be through the handle or the point. For him who loves, its metallic coldness will not destroy love, but will give the impression of being abandoned by God. Supernatural love has no contact with force, but at the same time it does not protect the soul against the coldness of force, the coldness of steel. Only an earthly attachment, if it has in it enough energy, can afford protection from the coldness of steel. Armour, like the sword, is made of metal. Murder freezes the soul of the man who loves only with a pure love, whether he be the author or the victim, so likewise does everything which, without going so far as actual death, constitutes violence. If we want to have a love which will protect the soul from wounds, we must love something other than God.

Love tends to go ever further and further, but there is a limit. When the limit is passed love turns to hate. To avoid this change love has to become different.

Among human beings, only the existence of those we love is fully recognised.

Belief in the existence of other human beings as such is love.""

[Link to whole passage](https://fleurmach.com/2016/03/27/simone-weil-love/)

The line about cold steel in particular intrigues me as there is a U2 song called ""Love is Blindness"" which uses the exact same phrasing,

""Love is clockworks and cold steel

Fingers too numb to feel

Squeeze the handle, blow out the candle

Love is blindness""

What do ya'll make of this? I take the U2 song to mean that real love is the ability/phenomenon that occurs when two people are blind to each other's flaws and/or purposefully ignore them to be caught up in love. It's a weird, but somewhat optimistic view of love.

But how does this relate to the Weil quote?",love,1541398519,mcafc,0,1,True,2018-11-05
19,Am I experiencing true love?,"There’s this girl, I’ve known her for 6 months. I met her through mutual friends. We attend the same university but we aren’t in the same classes. Anyway when I got first introduced to her I didn’t think much of her, I am someone who does not give attention to people unless they work for it and try to achieve it. That was my goal with this girl. I didn’t have any intentions of being with her or any plans, just that I never gave her attention because it’s who I am. I’m lazy and unbothered and I want others to try for me, not me for them if that makes sense. If people in general don’t try it doesn’t bother me, they will move on with their lives and I wouldn’t care because I am not asking for their attention if they choose to give it that’s their choice. 

Several weeks after being introduced she was there. She was hanging out with the people I do. I spoke to everyone normally besides her. She’d constantly look at me and I’d notice without showing it, I didn’t know what it mean and I got very curious, eventually I found out through one of my friends that she thought that I was attractive, and sooner I found out she calls many guys attractive. It does not necessarily mean she likes them or loves them. I’ve been called attractive many times when I was younger, in high school. I didn’t try and pursue anything with anyone when I was given so many opportunities, like I said I don’t try, I’m lazy and I want others to work for my attention. I can’t be bothered to go through effort for love or to mess around with a girl. This was my mentality I grew up with until a situation I went through in my final two years of high school. It was these last 2 years that girls spoke to me, called me attractive. While I was given compliments, I was very observant and took my attention away from these other girls and focused on this one girl. New to the school, she seemed so innocent and insecure. Something about her that I didn’t know really got to me. Every time I looked at her I felt something deep, I felt a connection yet I didn’t know who she was and neither did she. Anyway to speed things up. I had a thing for this girl for 2 years, I called it love. I went 2 years looking at this girl, observing her every move, the way she speaks, acts etc. without saying a single word until it was time I was about to graduate. I had feelings for this girl for so long and have done nothing about it. As time went on I spoke to her, keeping it cool, going very slowly not trying to push things until people catches onto things and she found out that I liked her. She didn’t really open up and so didn’t I but I found out she was very religious and was unable to be in a relationship that won’t last. That really bothered me, I finally after so many years thought that I was changing, that my mentality wasn’t getting the better of me, because I was sooo lazy and so Unbothered and just I was getting out of that miserable time I got back into it. I’d say I’m young and old at the same time, I’m 19 years old. I have never been in a proper relationship. I had a thing with this girl when I was 12 which lasted a week but it wasn’t serious or anything. The sole purpose of why I haven’t had a relationship was because I can’t see myself being with a girl then down the line ending things, because of the way I am, If I fall for someone that’s who I plan on sticking with for life. I’ve always had that thought since I was young. I haven’t tried to pursue anything with girls and I’ve had chances to but I never saw it go anywhere. I haven’t do anything with girls and I don’t plan to. I don’t plan on being in relationships for experience, I plan on learning with the one I want to be with. Many people say that time will heal all wounds or that you’ll eventually get bored and move onto another girl and this seriously pisses me off. Why do people all fall for the same perception of love? Why do people believe each other? Why do people think they are always correct. Why don’t they think about those fair few that could potentially be different, that aren’t like everyone else, and that’s me. I’m weird and I’m like no one trust me. I tried once for a girl and it didn’t work and I gave it everything and I gave up and left, time hasn’t healed my wounds, this girl is part of my sub conscious and she’ll always be there, people need to understand that. I had feelings for this girl for 2 years without trying until I gave it everything before I graduated. I fall hard. I can’t escape it. Once I fall I get attached and I can’t back out and that’s what makes me different because at some point people will fall hard for someone and months or years later they will fall out of love. I’ve never experienced love prior to this girl and it’s not because I can’t get anyone it’s because I won’t allow myself to fall for a girl I can’t. That’s what makes me different. I’d rather be single than get a girl. I’d rather not be married. I just want one person that I love so much to love me back and that is all I need. I don’t need someone with a perfect face or perfect body. I am someone that does not going messing around with girls, I never have and I never will. I’ve been serious since I was young and that’s never going to change, my emotions are heightened and I believe they are further than heightened it’s always been that way I can’t joke around with someone I want to be with, I can’t use them, I can’t mess around, you know why? because I’m weak and I’m unable to do it. There was a instance where I saw another side of myself which I have never encountered and I went against everything and love did it to me. I’ll get into it shortly. 

Sorry if I went off topic a bit, that’s a little backstory as to why I am the way I am. Anyway continuing... after several weeks of this girl being around me and our other friends, I still didn’t say a word, I acted like she didn’t exist, I didn’t hate her or have anything against her, I just didn’t want to bother because of my past. Until one night everyone was together and we were all talking and there was point where she spoke to me and I’m someone who won’t sit there and be quiet even though I’m insecure, so I spoke to her. Every time she spoke or asked questions, I’d reply in a very dry manner. She spoke more and more and eventually I started speaking more, not as much as I usually do but I spoke, this rooms weeks, roughly a month and a half of me not speaking to her or replying in a dry manner. Anyway we spoke and after everyone went home, I felt the same way again and as for the following weeks I went back to the way i was not speaking and being unbothered. I know she tried and kept trying and after 2 plus months she finally broke me. She was dedicated this girl, every single time I saw her she’d do anything she could to try and speak to me or go to our friends and get them to tell me to her. And after a week of that continuously happening I felt something, I barely knew her but I felt attached she was someone who always got what she wants but she was dedicated, nice, generous and kind to everyone. So I spoke and spoke and opened up until one day I said fuck it and told her on text that I liked her. She told me you can’t like me and she had her reasons, her past and the way she treated people and I respect that. I was so confused from that moment on because she gave me attention, she treated me like I was her boyfriend but I wasn’t, we were just friends and because I liked her and I didn’t know at the time whether it was love or like.. but I felt like I never wanted to let her go. We spoke and spoke and we had arguments and I’d open up about my feelings every couple of days. I couldn’t hold them in and she told me she doesn’t do feelings so she didn’t know how to respond to the way I spoke to her. I didn’t know what to say, what to do to convince her that I loved her but I wasn’t sure myself I just wanted her for some apparent reason. After this occurring for a solid 3 weeks, everyone in the group went out to be beach and after a couple of people left it was me and her with 2 other guys. I just sat there and all of a sudden I started tearing up heavily, she looked at me and said what’s wrong and we went somewhere and I told her, mumbling and unable to speak, that I love her, that I have fallen for her and I want her. We were there for an hour speaking about my feelings and she was there to comfort me but I didn’t know how she felt but she made me feel slightly better. Moving past that day she started to grow a connection with me, she didn’t love me but she liked me and from getting to know her she never really liked anyone. We spoke every single day on text, saw each other in person as many times as possible throughout the week and we were always open until I did something that really fucked me over, in no way did I intend to do it, I made a terrible mistake that I regret and she didn’t speak to me, she told me beforehand that she saw potential in me and could’ve fallen for me and I know for a fact she doesn’t fall easily. I fucked up and I wanted to make it up to her, she said she’d never speak to me again and that she hated me and I’d try but I didn’t try hard enough, I wanted her so badly I didn’t know what to do and I was so confused. After days and days of texting we came to an arrangement that could potentially not completely but potentially could work around and get back to being friends. But I wanted more than friends. I told myself I’d do everything to make it up and every now and then I make stupid mistakes and I don’t want to, I really don’t want to because I love her. To summarise we are cool now, as in we are friends and back then we were something more and right now I’m trying my best to get back to the way it was. We’ve had so many arguments and there was so many times where things went so terribly and she had the right to leave but everything something occurred I’d go back and I’d never leave because I can’t leave, I can’t let her go. She wants me to become the best person I can be and be truthful about everything and right now I’m following that path and everything is going good, I want to be better I want to do better. I have fallen completely for this girl, she’s on my mind every single morning when I wake up, every single night when I sleep, she’s on my mind during the day for hours on end. She’s in my dreams at least twice a week. I fantasise a lot about a future with her, I play our scenarios that if I did this what will the consequences be in my mind, I always think twice before I act because I don’t want to make anymore mistakes. If I don’t see her for a couple hours it drives me crazy and I stress out, I get really stressed because I want to see her every minute of the day. I constantly wake up throughout the night and text her. I make sure that she sleeps before I do otherwise I can’t sleep feeling safe at night when she’s up and I’m not. She has to be the last person I’m talking to before she sleeps. I make sure she isn’t messing around with other guys at work. Even though she told me it’s nothing serious I still worry. She’s played pranks on me where she said she’d be leaving the state and living elsewhere and every single time I’d fall for it and my first instinct was don’t let her go, so I told her that if you’re leaving I’m going to come visit you every once in a while. Even though we are friends she knows I love her truely and I’ll never let go of that it’s been months but the connection seems to be getting stronger and stronger by time and due to my past I know myself, I know I won’t ever let her go. She still sees potential and I’m doing everything I can to make it up and she’s giving me time and I really appreciate that she’s doing this for me because I want to be better. I love her so much that not even she completely understands.

We were in the grocery store a little while ago. We split to grab different things and knew he was already done waiting for me. As I was getting closer to the end of the isle, and to him, I saw a woman turn the corner and he came into her view. 

And oh my gosh, did she like what she saw! 

Her eyes shot up, she did the classic double take, and I think she actually hated that she had to keep walking away from the sexy stranger in the grocery store. 

I just kept smiling to myself as I watched this woman oggle at my guy, I even slowed down so that I could just watch from a distance.

It made me realize how truly lucky I am. And it was a nice reminder for me to never take him for granted.

I’ve been hurt to the point of questioning what I do wrong to be so unworthy of love. I thought I had no way out of this mindset that men are awful and love is not worth it. What was the point of me loving and caring and giving and giving and giving and never receiving the same?  


But, I have found him. A man who gives as much as I do, someone who loves as hard as I do, someone deserving of my love. With him, love is in the small things - coffee in bed, kisses on whatever part of me he can reach when he’s half asleep, my favourite snack ready and waiting, words of kindness that he doesn’t even know mean the world to me, his appreciation of even the small things I do for him. I see it in his eyes and I hear it in his words and I feel it in his touch - none of which I’ve experienced before. I know I am surrounded by his love and it feels amazing. 


I was never unworthy of love - I was worthy of a greater love than I could’ve imagined. ",love,1541464818,throw-away-afteruse,19,1,True,2018-11-05

but together they are truly brilliant

a dim, sparkling amber

She's a sweet revolation

38,I just wanna shoot my love but can't,"I wrote this to an askreddit post and decided to post it here. So I can find people to talk about her. origin of my love and how it got bigger is a bit complicated but I can talk about it in private with anyone who wants to

Sadly I am too shy to talk to her about my feelings while she **totally** knows. I gifted some books because what she only did was studying her lessons. so I give her Fahrenheit 451, a stefan zweig book, and the speech of Atatürk ""Nutuk"" since she loves him like every Turk. then a week later, she gives them back because she **totally** already had them and her family didn't let her to accept gifts. That really broke my heart. Now I am switching to passive stage like I was for 2 months. cause I missed being able to watch her, her hairs etc. normally I always smile even while there is nothing to smile. now I just don't wanna cause when she was giving them back, she was giving me the vibes of I won't be with anyone. but she didn't know how I loved her. she just thinks I love her because how cute she is (probably). while what I only want is to see her in the meal times, maybe after school since we both stay in school pansion but seems impossible. well that's what's mystic about love isn't it? not knowing if it will happen or you will just get sad in the end",love,1541512810,yigiteksi07,0,1,True,2018-11-06

43,heaven or here,"we all need someone to talk to, don’t we? to share an idea, a feeling, a care, an earth-shake that compels us to grab at thin air.  even a word with a mystery like God or Higgs-Boson is better than the nothing of black holed isolation.  i’ll reach for a heaven that isn’t there rather than surrender to a truth i can’t reasonably bear.

but that’s only good on certain days when i’ve heard angelic music or forgotten the vigilance of my ingrown despair.  

i appreciate your candor, your willing ear.  i even appreciate the hours when you’re not here.  those are the times when you’re most sacred, a saviour to me, a relief from the condition of human mediocrity.  then i believe in compassion and integrity, i even believe in ‘love one another’ and human dignity.   on certain days, when traffic flows easily and the sky is perfected color, i think i have faith in what we intend for each other.

but that’s only on good days when the i’ve reached the limit of self-induced pity making a ruin of what’s supposed to be heaven-sanctioned communion. 

when the heavy hand of self-critical defeat places its weight on the arrogance in me, i’ll bend a knee for the sake of saving something called ‘soul’ or ‘psyche energy.’  i’ll even go so far as to press my head to the floor, not rising til my debt doesn’t exist anymore.  i’ll deceive myself sitting unnaturally twisted in that prescribed meditation position, waiting for light to strike through my ignorance.  

that’s on fair to middling days when i’ve convinced myself that scripture’s wisdom and ancient philosophy are vastly superior than anything i’ll ever conceive.  

you’re a good listener or reader or imagined friend.  maybe your patience will pay off in the end, when somewhere secreted in my incoherence, you’ll uncover a truth or meaning the ancients missed, you’ll comprehend God’s equations and discover what doesn’t need proofs.

i’d expect heaven would be what you’re able to see.

52,A Difficult Situation,"I've been in love with my bestfriend for the past 6 years. It's getting to the point where it hurts me.

I have strongly liked this one girl for the last 6 years. I met her in the 8th grade. I knew I liked her as soon as I saw her. I spent that year trying to get her attention and at least make my way into her friend circle. Despite my feelings for her, I've never felt as if she felt the same way about me. I have dated 2 girl totaling about 4 years out of the past 6. Despite being in those relationships, my feelings for her never changed; I just hid it really well. We peaked about 2 years ago. After I left my most recent relationship (February), it has seemed like our friendship has been on the downhill. It hurts me. We both started college this Fall. We are at the same place. She is my bestfriend and I will doing absolutely anything for her. We hang out almost every week, but when we do, I feel like I'm losing her bit by bit. I act like nothing is wrong. I feel like she doesnt trust me. It seems like she seems uncomfortable being with just me and not with another one of our friends. That really concerns me because I really have no idea why. I give her her space. I dont get into her business. I feel like I'm losing her. I dont know how she feels. I feel alone. I cant talk to anyone about this either and that makes it harder. I'm struggling. She's my best friend, I cant lose that, but its hurting me. Being with her hurts me because I know I can't actually BE with her. Its hurting me. I don't know what to do.",love,1541577852,asheridan33,1,1,True,2018-11-07

It passed time, I had fun with it and I even created r/AdulteryHate just to keep shitting on it for myself! And it has served me well for that purpose. 

Recently I caught a couple (regular posters in r/adultery - where they knew they could have posted with zero issues) who tried to come HERE to be all lovey and to trick you guys into supporting their affair! 

They wanted to play lovers instead of actually being affair partners...

Anyways, I told my guy all about this account. We laughed at other woman together, I read him some of my pettiness all while he just... Understood. 

He never LIKED what I did with this account (I could tell), but he didn't push me one way or the other either.

He checked in on me to be sure I wasn't using this account as a crutch for something else. He never pushed me to quit trolling them, he never told me what he thought I should be doing instead. 

He just listened to me. I have never expressed myself very well. I journal, always have. Maybe this account has helped me be less afraid to express myself... Meh, I think I just enjoy being catty to catty woman.

I really thinks it's been him. Us. Growing up together.

He has long started to catch me giving up the better dished plate, the bigger piece of pizza, not telling him what I actually want and instead telling him what I think he wants etc.. Essentially shorting myself.

I never looked at it like I was shorting myself. 

But he has stopped accepting me shorting myself. So I ask for what I want. Not what is convenient, or closer, or what I think he wants.

54,I love my best friend,"My best friend’s baby passed away and I, of course, am sad. I never met the baby, she was only alive a couple of days, but it still struck me. I know it hasn’t fully hit her because she’s still in that stage of numbness and doesn’t believe it’s really happened as she explained it to me. I spent all day with her making her laugh because I know that smile is going to disappear once it starts to hit her, she even told me herself that right now she feels fine but later she knows she’ll realize and feel the pain. I just wanted to make her laugh and be happy, and she was. I love her, in a best friend way. I love watching her smile and laugh now because I know in that moment she feels happiness and as her best friend that’s all I want for her. I watched her sleep for a bit and it sounds creepy but she looked so peaceful and it made me happy to know that she wasn’t feeling any pain. I just hate that all that pain is going to hit her soon, it makes me sad to see her sad, but I’m going to be there as best as I can. I know this will take so much more time than anything else I’ve been with her for, but I’m going to be there every step of the way. I know this is something that will hurt years from now still because she lost a baby and time doesn’t change that because her baby will always be her baby and she’ll always miss her.

59,Can we repair an abusive relationship and avoid aggressiveness?,"I'm a 23F, have been with my anxious partner 24M for two years now. We both started the relationship at a very needy and lonely point of our lives. 

I was just realizing the crush which I was desperately giving all my love and hopes didn't give a single shit about me and only used me for the free appreciation and he was off and on trying to get his mentally unstable ex back. We both had all our friends telling us how the situations were hopeless but only one another could make believe we were both walking dead end roads. Then one day I went to a party at his place and he declared his love for me. Until that moment I was - pardon the language contradiction - straightly homo but that night I slept hoping he climbed into my bed.

A few months went by as our friendship and desire grew without breaks. I've been all my life trying to connect with others through my weird taste in general but had never felt such a strong connection with anyone before. One day I had a big family discussion and couldn't bear sleeping at home. I talked to him, he came to pick me up, have dinner with his family and spend the night. I was feeling pretty bad and he offered to cuddle on bed with me. From that moment on we poured every single drop of love, affection and aflictions into a relationship.

From our first fights I got the message we were desperately dependant on each other and since I'm a avoidant in terms of attachment the least heartbreak we had I tried to end all. In the other hand, his ex always broke up after fights also and he carries this trauma of sudden abandonement. His behaviour went increasingly more aggressive, after half a year of being together, he started to block me from going home at the middle of discussions. First he offended me and the more we understood each other, the more we knew how to piss each other off even unconsciously. 

We've both been anxiously depressed and constantly getting high on weed, alcohol and ocasionally acid. I stoped smoking everyday just last year, when I graduated from college, but kept getting high with him almost every single time we met. He dropped out of law school the year before we started dating, focused on getting into the music production business but blowed off his first chance by not being able to arrive on time.

We both being totally free of work and activities this year spiralled into a toxic relationship. I stayed with him more than with my family this year and poured into him all my worries and anxiety about being jobless and hopeless, I'm an international relations bachelorette and there's little opportunity for both of us here in Brazil. 

If our lives weren't anxiously depressive enough, the political situation in the country went from ridiculous to beyond pessimist. As we both saw it coming, Bolsonaro achieved to unite more than half of the country in the name of prejudices as class hatred, sexism and racism and the political persecution is just growing exponencially. Brazil was a country full of hidden hate and visible genocide of minorities before and now the president elect glorifies this murderous mentality through the country. We've been lazily planning to move to Canada but we're both hands-tied terrified.

Politics apart, we couldn't be more uncertain of and anxious about the future. Our discussions got more and more personally provocative and agressive. One day last month he called me crazy and screamed at me for hours and I couldn't bear it anymore. I spit on him and almost hit his beautiful face. He bit my arm as I shoved him to the ground. I couldn't believe I was capable of doing all that, for me it was over there and then he forgave me and acknowledged he provoked me into it.

For two weeks I felt dissociated while with him and guilty the whole time. I'm never certain if what I feel is really love but I kept doing my part on this high maintenance relation. Last week we spent a few days at the beach to keep our minds away from the political tragedy of the capital and into one of the strongest sativa strains we got our hands into. From the first toke I realized it messed up my head too much, but he kept smoking more and more. He also took some acid the day before his parents went to spend some days with us there and since the morning after his mood went berserk. He only talked to me to complain about every single available point to hurt me and stayed in his room getting high the whole time except for the meals. 

We planned to go to a music festival last saturday and every single day he made sure to demonstrate he wasn't going to be mentally able to go. That saturday he woke up saying he couldn't bear stay with his parents anymore and was going home to stay alone. I knew if I went with him we were going to fight nonstop the way back so I refused to go with him and avoided staying even near him the whole day. Dinner time comes and he kept complaining about me at the table. The discussions go on and his parents decide to take a walk outside and then he fights with me and violently holds me. I shouted what he was doing and his despair just exploded. His parents heard and came back, he screamed in front of them that I was completely crazy and he would do them the favor of taking me home. Off and on we discussed the whole night and neither had reason nor emotional conditions to stay together. At the lowest point he threatened suicide if I wouldn't stay with him.

The next day we went back and I asked for a few days on my own, he agreed to not bother talking to me. I talked about all of our agressions with my mom and my best friend and both agreed I was risking my life in the relationship. I spent the next days calmly and sadly considering it couldn't be over-er. 

Then today he said he misses me and was much ashamed of what he had done. I said we had to talk and immediatly he figured out my mind was set to break up. He came here already desperate. I said I didn't love him anymore and could never trust him again. He had a panic attack, threatened suicide again and shoved me out the way. As he was almost running away I called his mother to say he was threatening his life and he pushed me to the ground, bruising my elbow and thigh. As it escallated he got more desperate and I asked for the guards of the building to help me keep him away.

He stayed for a time outside asking for me to talk and apologize while i waited for his mom. Their parents did next to nothing, but my mom called him to ask him how he was and offer support. He insisted on talking to me and after some 40 messages declaring apologies and desperate love and a few calls I answered him. He said he couldn't make it without me, many more times that I'm the love of his life, as he always said and that he needed some sign that there was still a chance, or at least that I keep my mind open to it. We talked a lot and he showed further appreciation that I was still trying to help him after such pains and betrayals. 

Then it clicked me: I can't really tell what are my sentiments towards him right now as it was always difficult to me to know my true feelings. I hadn't given the exact promise he asked for but can't help showing my affections. He agreed we need some time apart and promised he would get better only if it would be, at least a flock of a chance, to stay with me.

Now the more I try to keep my mind away from it, the more I remember how we combine. I can see growth in his life and how I helped it make real. Few things in life are more important to me than being able to help and eventually succeed. Our sex life was close to heaven and that's really rare given our kinks. He also was never violent in this aspect and I felt totally secure opening up to him.

But he seems like two completely different individuals to me: one is the most caring person I've ever met and loved so much. He keeps telling me I'm the love of his life, I don't believe in this kind of concept but until now he's my broken love of my broken life also. But there's also the other side, when he's ashamed of himself I can tell he's not there at all. I've never seen so much anger in one's eyes. It hurts so much that I can't explain. I loved and still love deeply his kind self but am afraid to death of the angry one. 


I thank you gently for taking the time to read it all and wonder what's your opinion about it, is it possible a life together where we avoid this level of aggressiveness? Can we repair these traumas and eventually lead a healthier relationship? If so, do you have any suggestions about controlling anger towards the loved ones and deferring conflicts? Can we, if anybody, make it work and not kill each other?

I'm more certain it wouldn't work out but feel the slightest hope could make me give it another chance. I went through therapy my entire teenage years and had awful experiences. He insisted the whole relationship that I seek professional help and I gave it only a single hopeless try some months ago. I know I'm not stable but had never felt so steady my entire life as I were with his gentle self. I set an appointment for therapy because now I really need help and the most opinions I could get. I feel so confused and hurt, I've had some real suicidal and self harming phases in my adolescence but never had such difficulty about facing my own feeling, eating and sleeping has also been the hardest ever. Everybody tells me to focus exclusively on myself but this hecking stubborn self loves an homeric challenge and life puzzle. I just don't want to risk my life and can't see clearly how big of a threat and trauma it could turn into.

TL;DR Just broke up a relationship, both parts with anxiety and depression, violence grew out of hand but a spark of hope made me spent two hours before bed writing this and questioning: what is love babe dont hurt me dont hurt me no more

68,"You. My best friend, you.","You come home from work and you're tired.   You're at the door, taking your shoes off, putting your stuff down, wanting to break down from all the stress and exhaustion. You stand by the door way and try to breathe.
You hear music in your kitchen and you're surprised. You rush to where the noise is coming from and find mellow music playing and soup boiling. You're confused.
""Boy, you should take better care of yourself!"" You turn around and see her. Your best friend with a huge grin on her face. And for a moment, you felt peace. And the next moment, you felt stupid and embarrassed for forgetting that she was staying over a few days. 
You give her a nervous smile at the fact that she found out how you completely let yourself go. ""This soup is the only thing I can whip up from what isn't expired in your fridge.""
She makes you eat soup, relax, and she tells you about her recent adventures. You didn't have wine in your apartment, but something about her being there right now, just makes you feel so warm inside. After laughing and talking, you both come to a quiet moment where you're both just smiling and reminiscing the past.
It was getting late and you have work tomorrow. You insist on her sleeping on your bed and you sleeping in the couch. She gives in and gets ready for bed.
You check on her one last time before heading to the couch. ""Hey you, come here for a sec.""
Of course all sorts of thought came to mind, but you worked your way to the bed cautiously and curiously.
In one swift movement, she grabbed your arm and now you're laying on top of her, head on her chest, wrapped in her arms.
Your mind goes blank except for the screaming voice saying ""SHE'S YOUR BEST FRIEND!""
Her hand moves and strokes your hair gently. ""Hey, you know you can tell me anything right? You're too tired and stressed out. You can't even take good care of yourself anymore. You're supposed to tell me these things so I can come take care of you."" She says in a warm, soft voice that you begin to cry.
You wrap your arms around her waste and bury your face on her chest. 
She gently hums a tune and you fall asleep.",love,1541650116,ArabianMintTea,4,1,True,2018-11-07
69,"Dear Friend, Love Is Worth It","This is a letter I wrote to a younger friend about why it’s important to believe in positive things, especially love. It might not work out like you planned, but positivity gives you the strength and humility to learn in any process. I hope you find value in this as did I in writing and reflecting on it.

Dear Friend,

I understand that it can be difficult to find the right person to date. But I can’t just stand by and let you believe that just because it’s difficult, that it’s not worth it. When you find the right person, maybe you won’t be together forever. Maybe things will go wrong. But you will most definitely learn. We often see perfect relationships on social media, but these are ultimately fiction — a fragment of people who are a lot more dynamic and strange than just a few snapshots. Try not to be fooled by any narrow concept of what a relationship should be. Get out, be vulnerable and get to know someone. And don’t believe that a handful of negative people represent the whole: it’s simply not true; this type of thinking only propogates negativity and suffering. I’m sure that right now, someone valuable and worth it might be thinking the same thing of other people out there. And maybe like you, they have a friend telling them that not all people are the same, and hopefully they’ll snap out of this negative thinking. We cannot let negative thoughts ever stop us from achieving our goals, be it career or love. The path you’ve chosen for your life is probably difficult. I’m sure there are many people who tell you that it’s not worth it, or that you’re crazy for pursuing it – but you still pursue it regardless because it gives you and others around you happiness. Romance and relationships are the same way friend. We cannot let the world convince us that it’s not worth it. Everything that’s worth it will take time, right? Let’s encourage others to not only give happiness, but hope that their dreams about love and success are valid and attainable.

Your friend,

Jay-Ram

The girl that I liked back then a ton was so pretty and seemed smart. I haven’t thought about her for years after I talked about it but suddenly today that just hit me again. I feel like maybe she just rose my standard too high or something like that which is why I haven’t had a crush on anyone in almost 4 years?

83,Dream Date. But realistic enough.,"It's Christmas night. We're in a dark, cozy restaurant bar where music plays, and there are people dancing and swaying on a dedicated dance floor. We are having a good time, catching up with all that has happened in the past year, laughing and having fun. After a while, I drag you to the dance floor as the food is taking an eternity to arrive. You're hesitant at first but agree reluctantly. Probably because we rarely meet it’s in our best interest we enjoy every moment in each other’s company. It's some jazzy song so we just groove randomly to the tune, bopping our heads along the way. The mood suddenly becomes more subtle and mellow. ""It's for the couples,"" he announces and slowly proceeds to play Thinking Out Loud by Ed Sheeran. It's kind of exactly how I had pictured. You in the red baby doll dress signifying the Christmas spirit, and well me, let's leave the details out on that one. 
We come closer. My right hand on your shoulder blade, your left hand running parallel to my hand and resting on my shoulder. Automatically we start swaying to the song as if we were made for it. Lights out, world shut out, feels like the spotlight is on us. You, me and the music to make this night just a bit more special. Our eyes transfixed, there's nothing to ruin OUR moment. I lead you to a turn, and as you complete it, I pull you closer and grab you by your waist.  Both your arms on my shoulders, our foreheads touch, and we giggle a bit. The song draws to a close. There are cheers all around. Not for us, but towards a beautiful evening. And as we share a kiss, I couldn't help but think what would the night be like if you weren't my muse to this episode.

90,Feel like love is lost to me...,"I want to experience real love. But some days I feel like I am too broken to love. 

I had a very abusive childhood, not going to get into it, but lets just say my adopted father did not love me. My first relationship, in high school, was with an emotionally abusive guy 6 years older then me. He told me that he loved me more then he had ever loved anyone, that I was the most important relationship of his life. It was my first love, and my first boyfriend, and I believed that it was real, so I looked past everything about him that was terrible. He cheated on me lots and was really degrading to me. He eroded my self-esteem, which wasn't really great at that time anyways. We were together 6 years, off and on. When I finally left him he admitted to me that he had never really loved me, at least not the way he said, and that he just created a fantasy for me to keep me from leaving him because I was hot, good in bed, intelligent and in college, and would always support him. I was basically a trophy girlfriend. 

I was pretty messed up for years, and kind of spun through a series of ""not relationships"" with guys. Some of them were nice guys, some were not nice and were using me, but none of them were really love. I was also assaulted by someone who I though was a friend, and that I had a crush on, which kind of sent me into a tailspin for a bit. 

At the same time as all of this was happening, I was trying to make my life better. I went to counselling, I started dealing with my past, I graduated college with straight A's. I couldn't find a job related to my degree, so I worked as a server and lucked into a seasonal position with really decent tips. I would travel the world on the off-season. 

Slowly over years I have built myself up. I have created a good life for myself. I went back to school and got a great job. I have amazing friends. I have enough to be happy. But I am in my 30's now, and I find it so hard to find a partner or love. Lots of men want to date me, but it is so hard to open up, and I have so many bad patterns. I feel so broken. With really great stable men, I sometimes think they cant handle or wouldn't understand the pain in my childhood and my past. I tend to be attracted to guys who have had some kind of serious heartbreak, broken people like me. But it is really hard to connect with broken people. I always am chasing after guys who don't have anything to give me, I guess because my hope is that they will understand me. And I can't control my reactions in relationships. I can observe them, but not control them. When things are good and the guy is giving me lots of attention, I am so full of anxiety. I can get attacks of anxiety, and think that the guy is going to flip, and show me a dark side, like is secretly a drug addict, or wants to hurt me. It doesn't last long, and I recognize that it is just my past catching up with me, but it is hard to deal with. Usually that causes men to take a step back, understandably. But my partner drawing away from me also freaks me out, and hurts me so badly, which causes more anxiety reactions, and it just goes from there. For some reason it always ends in this pattern where men never actually end it with me, they just slowly fade out of my life. Because I am so much to deal with, and it is hard. It also takes me forever to get over any kind of relationship that stirs up feelings in me. For example, I just recently, classically, blew up a relationship that could have been something. I only dated the guy for like two weeks to a month, but I still think about him every night more than a month later. It is driving me crazy. 

One of my friends told me I am the strongest person she knows, when life knocks me down I just get up and keep on fighting. But when it comes to love, I just feel so broken. And I am so sad. The truth is that my first relationship, which was a lie, is still the longest and most impactful relationship of my life. And that hurts me so much, because it was not love. He was using me. It makes me feel hopeless that anyone could love me, because it is hard to get past these reactions. And I don't even know how to be in a relationship. I have heard people say that relationships take work. I believe that. I want to be the girlfriend of my dreams. I want to give love and be affectionate and supportive, and trusting. I want to be the kind of person that writes love notes and does stupid things like that. I want to know what that feels like. I feel like I have missed out on so much. But I don't know how to get there.

The last time she asked me (september 15th), she told me her ex was calling her and she told me that she wanted me, not him, but I said no...

So next day I wrote her that I missed her... She did answer, and told me in a nice way to stop trying to get in touch with her, she wrote that she was thankful for everything that happened but she had reasons(secret reasons) for what she was doing, she told me not to answer that message...

I haven't been in a LTR before so the whole thing is somewhat foreign to me. I know the typical single guy's mindset is very freeing. We can be with different girls, and we can hop from one girl to the next in our fantasies because we're not tied emotionally to anyone. Girls at work, girls around town, friends of friends, anyone can pop up in our fantasies and that variety really fulfills any lust or desire we could ever feel in your whole lives.

105,Spoiled.,"We got a new couch last weekend and it gave us the perfect opportunity to organize a little!

And in doing that, I came across some of the sentimental stuff I have kept from gifts he has given me over the years. 

Every rose, jewelry box, little gift bag, box of chocolates, etc. from the last 5 years together. 

I have kept Every. Single. One.

I also kept a brown paper bag that held my lunch for a day only because he drew me a picture and wrote a note on it before I left for work. 

And I have left a single piece of chocolate in each box of chocolates that he has given me. 

Those chocolates mean more to me than gold.

It's been this way for 5 years, I can't imagine I will be able to keep this up much longer. But I plan to! 

Also, since moving in with him, I haven't taken the trash (or the recycling) out.. And I've never pumped gas into the car either! Don't know how to and I haven't needed to learn yet!

I'm generally closed and reserved but ever since I met her, she's constantly made me feel more and more at ease and helped me get through a lot.

That brings me to my partner:

My current partner is there to lean on when I’m having an episode, or after I wake up from a nightmare. They accept me for who I am, despite my scars and my trauma, and they love me so much. I’m smiling now thinking of them. They believe in me, and my dreams. Even when my parents didn’t believe I could go to college, my partner helped me, and I actually got a scholarship to my first choice school.

I’m so in love. So deeply in love.

122,What do I do.,"I made a post here a while ago, regarding my story with a girl that I’m in love with. Things are very complicated right now, we have arguments here and there and they are initiated because I open up about my feelings and it’s difficult because she can’t relate to me. I’ve told her many times about how I feel but every time I open up I bring up something new and I do it because I love her and I want her to understand that I truely love her. Sometimes she’s fine with me talking about how I feel and sometimes she doesn’t like it because she doesn’t do feelings. She is someone that doesn’t love at all. A couple months ago we were good, we were friends we weren’t anything more but we had so much more going on, we’d stay up every single night and talk for hours, we’d always be together in person, I’d tell her how I felt and she didn’t mind. We spent a lot of time together alone and she really liked talking to me. She just liked me and as it went on she got closer and closer to me. She saw potential in me and she could’ve actually fell in love with me if it went that way. But I did something that really fucked me over and it’s been more than 3 months since I did that. Ever since then, every single day I’ve been trying to get back where I was. I’ve texted her every single day and still doing it till today. I’m very attached, very very attached and that won’t change I need her to understand that. Right now she’s studying and she is stressed due to wanting to get top grades and I understand that, but every single day I feel like I’m getting further and further apart from her because I only see her once-twice a week at university and it’s not alone time, it’s time that everyone spends together, our friends. I can’t behave normal in front of everyone when she’s around because I have feelings for her and she wants me to behave normal like all of our friends and interact with everyone. But I’m not like everyone else I can’t look at her and everyone else and expect to be having s normal conversation as friends per usual would do because I’ve been through a lot with her. She tells me to go with the flow and let things go the way they should. She sometimes tells me that I bother her and annoy her because I want to talk and she’s been busy this past week. She is very aware that I love her and with time will she hopefully fall for me. I’m someone who is willing to give everything to her but she doesn’t see it or realise it and I’ve told her multiple times. I won’t let her go because I’m too attached and I can see myself spending the rest of my life with her. If she hated me, didnt want anything to do with me she would’ve told me, she’s someone who won’t care, doesn’t care enough. I know what she’s capable of because I’ve seen a side to her that I’ve only seen and I’ll say it confidently. I know she’s capable of loving me and I need fucking help because I don’t want to ruin this. ",love,1541983756,GhastlyGorgon,5,1,True,2018-11-11

of what had yet to become the sky
appeared a beaming smile
and silenced one loud cry.

at first he seemed quite strange;
he was eerie, lost and shy.
but soon that random stranger
turned out to be my guy.

I could see he really liked me,
and for long I'd wonder why.
I thought he might be trying
to bathe me in a lie.

but I started seeing clearly 
as the days went by.
I needn't no more remedies,
his kisses made me high.

in this night of soothing silence
next to him I lie;
once there stood a lake of tears
that he has now made dry.

so when he takes me by the hand,
and looks me in the eye
I just can't help but wish
to never say goodbye.",love,1542023287,matatahakuna98,2,1,True,2018-11-12

154,A sweet story I've always wanted to tell...,"In high school, I worked at a common red-roofed pizza restaurant. Behind our store was an apartment complex. There was a young couple that lived there that often came in at lunch, ordered a pizza for takeout and sat on the bench near the door until it was ready.

One of things I noticed was they weren't attractive and didn't seem very smart.  Not charitable of me, I know; I was at an age when those were things I noticed.  From looks to dress to hygiene to mousey temperament, they both seemed the sort who had few, if any, friends.

And they were so in love!  While I cooked their pizza and manned the register, I'd see them sitting on the bench, close together; their hands clasped tightly or his arm protectively around her shoulder as she leaned against him.  Occasionally they would kiss a quick peck on the lips.

It was never an inappropriate display of affection; no groping or long kisses. Their mood was relief, not passion. When I watched them, it felt like they had found each other drifting in a stormy sea, clinging to a raft they had lashed together.  They held hands against churning waves and stole quick kisses because finally someone wanted to kiss them back.

Many years later, after decades of life, I look at my wife and feel exactly the same.",love,1542114596,fishead62,5,1,True,2018-11-13

157,Would like opinions on this writing I wrote this morning.,"Have you ever had a moment in your life where one small instance, a mere five to ten seconds change the way you thought about things, the way you saw things. Challenge your very feelings and what you thought you knew about yourself. It was a feeling with no name. I don't even begin to know how to describe it accurately. Surreal would be a good term to use. I didnt understand at the time. Was it even a real instance? I could not make the distinction at the time. It's the only time this almost supernatural feeling will arise. The eyes are said to be the window into the soul and I agree. Those eyes...I can see them when I close mine. Is that feeling I get the energy when you see another true soul? Is this a normal occurrence for people to experience? I've had connections with people but this seems so otherworldly and has stayed with me all these years. Is this some form of concept from quantum mechanics where certain particles are entangled regardless of distance? I try my best to view this rationally but I dont think I can anymore, I dont think I want to. What brought those eyes to me, pure chance, quantum entanglement, fate, destiny. Whatever the answers are I dont want to lose them. They pull me in no matter what I do. I've ran, I've forgotten, I've fought this pull on me. The truth still remains. I do not desire to hide from those eyes anymore. I want to embrace that five to ten second moment so long ago and all the ones that have happened since then. I want the feeling in my life. I know now it's the only one true feeling I've ever had. Why ignore the truth any longer? Why fight what the universe has set in place? Why ignore the eyes you don't want to really ignore? They are pulling me and in this instance I won't fight it any longer. Take the plunge into uncertainty, the unknown. In the simplest way I can put this feeling after wrinting....I want to fall into those eyes and never leave, I want to share my soul with the soul I see behind that iris. I want to share the truth with who I see looking back at me.I want to stay in the beautiful world in those eyes....your eyes...it has always been your eyes....",love,1542130307,hoppy126,0,1,True,2018-11-13

I‘m almost never seeing him because he‘s working so damn hard to put money in my life so I can live as easy as it could be possible. I don’t want money. I want to spend time with my dad.
My school mates hate me. I hate being in school. I hate being dumped by this boy..
Thus I’m trying to do good things and everyone is laughing at me because I try. I basically hate my life. But I just came home and huged my dad and he gave me her post card. She literally saved my day. She saved my week. She damn saved my life.

I just saw and felt the perfect things WITH HIM. I hate when someone‘s touching me but when he even put his hands on my shoulders I wanted more and more. He made me want more of him, every little piece of him. He made me wanna feel his hands on my face, his lips on mine, his hands around my chest, around ME.

To be honest, it’s not really that kind of perfect, I think. No, not even close. You’re driving me crazy. Fucking crazy. You’re never texting me back, except I text you a thousand messages. And when you finally text back, it’s just a lazy and pretty stupid message. Then I’m finally able to let you go. But what are you doing? You finally care about me (or you’re just acting like you are) and you say things like «I don’t want you to leave ME» «Don’t do that, please» «I wanna see you» and «stay». What the hell is wrong with you? Why are you doing things like that? You’re playing with me, I guess. I’m not saying you’re an asshole or something but why aren’t you with me? I just want to understand what to do. I want you. But I don’t know what I should do. I don’t want to leave. I want to kiss you. Forever. Like there’s no end. Can we do that without any problems or discussions? Can we just sit on a bench and talk like there’s no tomorrow? Or just lay in bed like we don’t have jobs? Or just sleep? Or just wake up and give each other a kiss like we’re married for 27 years? I want a kiss. I want you. Just you. At the moment there’s nothing holding me back from kissing you except of you. You’re saying you can’t see me. What’s the matter? Why you don’t even have fucking five minutes to see me? You don’t even have to move! I’m running for you. 
I’ve been living like this too long, just to lose it all in a week.

166,22f I think I’m still shocked he never reached out...was it really love if they don't care after," 

Essentially we broke up 6 months ago. Together 4 years.

He said to me ‘we need to talk’ so I suggested that he picked me end so we could drive somewhere.

He picked me up and parked next to a park on my street. He said it isn’t working and can’t ‘do this anymore.’ He blamed me for his university work quality going down hill (he had only seen me twice in 2 weeks) so I don’t understand how they would have been my fault. He basically broke up with me because he felt like he was living ‘2 separate lives’ with me being one of them and his friends and family being the other. We sat in silence for a few minutes before I said I was leaving, I remember my parting words were ‘I don’t know how I’ll get through this, but I will,’ to which he didn’t respond and I walked home. He hasn’t contacted me since.

I tried so hard to get on with his family but they were always so rude to me or ignored me…and he was never able to relies that and just decided that it was my fault they acted that way. His friends I found were not the nicest of people (bitched about people loudly while the person is a few feet away etc) and his best mate from uni openly said to me ‘he wasn’t taking any friendship applications as I already have an army behind me,’ which I found quite repulsive. All in all they were not really my type of people, but I was still polite. He started to be with them all the time and never invited me or tell me what happened. But I still stuck around.

I would do anything for her and thats my problem. While she has bought joy to my life again she is also deeply hurting me. She told me she can't love and that guys she hangs with is only lust. She tell me all about them and last time she said ""you'd like him."" That broke me. I don't know what to do? I want to just let go of her and stop talking, but at the same time she's my best friend and the thought of not having her in my life is a nightmare. I love her so much and want  to show her I'm strong but she keeps hurting me. I keep thinking shitty things about myself, how I'm such a loser and below these other guys. All I ever wanted was a chance, and I swore if I got it I wouldn't fuck it up.  I'm so upset  with myself I let this happen. Do I tell her that are relationship is becoming toxic for me or what?

177,Is it worth it?,"Since I (M,17) was 14 I’ve wanted to find ‘the one’ and settle down but the thing is, girls just aren’t that interested in me unless it’s sex.

Going throughout high school I’ve never really found anyone who I could see a future with at all until this one girl, who
I won’t name, came along and I haven’t been able to stop thinking about her, I talked to her for a while until I finally got the courage to ask her out, she said no and I took it well, if she just isn’t interested in who I am I can’t exactly change myself. Imo we’re pretty compatible: we have the same hobbies, same aspirations, same sense of humour and we’re both somewhat attractive (at least I’ve been told by many people that I am), I’ve managed to get over her pretty quick as it just wasn’t meant to be but during that I had a realisation.

Is there really anything I can get out of a relationship, I play guitar and piano, I can sing, I do acting classes as that’s what I want to do for my career so a lover could hold me back from that.

The problem is, although I want to focus on my passions I still feel like I’m missing some sort of affection plus when I turn 18 I want to travel the world for how ever long and I don’t want to do that by myself so what I’m asking you fellow redditors is are relationships really worth the anxious and the heartbreak or am I just better going at it alone

179,I’m dating my best friend.,"R and I have been friends since middle school. We moved to a new city together at 18 and were roommates for 5 years. We occasionally flirted, and things got more serious a few times. He lost his virginity to me during college. A few years after that,  we had some semblance of a relationship, but always kept it casual and noncommittal. Our friendship before anything else. 

In 2015, I began a relationship that became very rough very quickly. R introduced me to him, actually. He was very self conscious and controlling, and when he found out R and I had past history, forbade that I see or speak to him. I did it. It was a very confusing three years for me and I regret a lot. Especially the way I allowed myself to be treated, and the things I gave up on for the sake of the relationship.

A few months ago, one of my three dogs was diagnosed with progressive cancer. R and I lived together when I got her many years ago. He took care of her and loved her like his own. With my SO’s permission, as I explained how the dog transcended our own issues and he agreed he wanted to be more ok with things like this, I broke our non contact that I had initiated (R had tried to get in touch with me for years) to ask if he wanted to spend a day with her before we put her down. He agreed and we met at a gas station so he could take her out hiking. Seeing him again was surreal. When I went to pick her up later that day, I couldn’t help but smile, and even though we only talked for a few minutes, it felt like hours, and all of our history and friendship came pouring back. 

We put down my dog a few days after that. My SO went with me and was supportive. He always liked the dog. 

R and I kept talking after that. Just reconnecting our friendship. Catching up on our respective lives, about music, etc.

About a month later, my other senior dog went into acute renal failure. My SO at the time never liked her, and would often “joke” about getting rid of her even after I told him it bothered me tremendously. He didn’t go with me to visit her in the ER that was 45 minutes from home, but R did. I told my SO that I didn’t mind if he didn’t want to visit her, but I really wanted him to be there when I put her down. 

The ER called me at 3am and told me she had dramatically declined and needed to be put down. I went to wake up my SO (we had been staying in separate rooms for months, because we fought terribly at night, and he wanted my dogs to sleep on the floor which was a deal breaker for me after having them in bed for their entire lives). I told him she had declined and I had to put her down that night. He said, “Wow, I’m so sorry. That’s horrible. But I am so tired. I have to stay home. Can you grab me the Pepto? I have a stomach ache.” 

I grabbed him the Pepto and started to get ready alone. I called R, thinking he probably wouldn’t hear the phone or want to go anyway. He answered, and as soon as I told him she had to be put down that night, asked if he could come, and offered to pick me up and drive. I told my SO and off we went. 

We ended up getting back to our home town at around 7am. SO was at work, and I didn’t want to go home to sit alone, so we took my remaining dog to the beach and watched the sun rise, reminiscing and playing with the dog. We went out to get breakfast and coffee and just talked. It was both one of the saddest and happiest days of my life. Sad about the circumstances that brought it on. Happy to have R in my life as a friend again. 

I finally worked up the courage to break up with my SO a month or two later and I moved back in with my parents. My dad had been trying to get me to leave and come home for years so they accepted me readily. It’s crazy how other people can see how bad a situation is, but one cannot when one is in it. 

R and I began to hang out all the time. Finally one day we went to a drive in movie, and one thing led to another and we ended up making out and having sex. It was the best sex I have had in years. My relationship  prior was almost sexless (partially to blame is me for that, I’m sure). But this was intimate and emotional and fun. 

We went on a few dates. Stayed up all night talking many times. Reconnected our friendship but it went way beyond that this time. This was intimate and special. I got sick a few weeks ago, and he made me hot tea and brewed it with sour sop leaves he picked in his yard. I got a flat tire, and he drove out and helped me change it and get on the road. And all of this without the arguments and chastising I had become so accustomed to over the last few years. Just because he cared about me and wanted to help. 

And two days ago now, he asked if I wanted to be his girlfriend. He’s never had a relationship before, and as I said prior, I took his virginity and have been his only. He told me that no other girl has compared and that he wants to commit himself to me fully. 

I hesitated. I love him. And I am in love with him. I realized that the other day when he fell asleep next to me, and I just watched him breathe deeply, and I felt not only so safe and content, but a desire to make him feel that way, and the visualization that he did. 

But I still hesitated. I’ve been in an awful relationship for so long, and I know I am carrying baggage from it. R had to tell me the other day that he wasn’t lying to me, and he wouldn’t lie to me, over something silly (whether he tried a coffee drink I offered him). But it made me realize that I am worse for the wear emotionally right now. I also have so much that I need and want to improve on as a person. Things I am worried that it will be more difficult to work on if I am in another committed relationship. 

But I told him my reservations. He heard them, really heard them and understood them, and we talked. And I thought on it alone. And I have come to the conclusion that - I deserve happiness. I deserve to be in a relationship with somebody who truly loves me. Who treats me well. Who listens to me and deeply cares about me. And he deserves to be doted on, to be treated like the treasure that he is, to be cared for and loved and adored. 

And we talked and talked some more. Discussed what dating and labeling each other would entail. Discussed what we wanted and expected. 

And now I can officially say that I am dating my best friend. I am my best friend’s girlfriend. My best friend is my boyfriend. I am deeply and intimately committed to him, and to us. And for the first time in a long time, I feel so totally loved, and that I have so much love to give. 

Thanks for letting me ramble, folks of r/love. I love you all. &lt;3

184,Hell or High-water,"Another buzz and bing from my phone, I scramble to retrieve it from my pocket, hoping pleading with the universe that it’s your name with the ❤️ after it as I have you saved - Etsy, Amazon, Harley, Ford... once again it wasn’t from you. The last I talked to you, you were so incredibly angry. I hate that, I hate that you were mad at me. I hate when you don’t feel amazing. I want you to be happy all the time. I hate when you’re angry or down especially if that’s directed or caused by me. 

See I’ve only ever loved one woman. Just one. And that’s you. And that love has stayed alive for almost two decades in my heart - it survived so much and still burns just as furiously inside me as ever. There’s not a woman on this planet that I would choose over you - there’s not a person alive that could steal my attention from you. The guys call me whipped and I say - “yeah if you had what I have you’d be whipped too.” The girls on social media, they know I am in love with you, they try and they fail. I shut it down, every-time. Even when we were broken up, I shut it down and blocked them. I only want you. I won’t settle for less, and to me there is no “doing better” how could I possibly do better than a gorgeous woman who checks literally all my boxes? How? I couldn’t - Beyoncé was wrong about you - because I want you to never for a second get to thinking that I could ever replace you. 

You don’t hold a spot in my heart, you own the entire circulatory system. Your touch pumps life through my veins, your kiss breathes oxygen into my lungs, your gaze lights up my field of view. You’re the single most important thing in my life. I might be a dumb brute, I have bad table manners, and I’m very capable of being a jerk sometimes, but I am loyal and damnit I love you and I would NEVER nor have I EVER desired the company or companionship of another woman over yours. And I never will. 

I’m yours. 
Only yours. 

When you’re ready to talk, I’ll be here waiting just like I promised and just like I always have been. Until they put me in the ground, I will wait for you. 

I tried life without you. I wanted to end it. Don’t you ever question my devotion to you. You saved me. I owe you my life. And that’s exactly how long I want to be your man. For the remaining minutes of my existence. 

I’m willing to do whatever it takes to save our lives together. 
Therapy? Moving away? A long vacation? Eating glass? Hot coals on my ribs? Doesn’t matter - I’ll do it. 

I love you

186,"I had a crush on a girl for 4 years but when she asked me if I remembered her, I blurted out who she was.... I am such an idiot","I was in grade 6 when I first met her. She was a classmate. She was outgoing and lively while me, on the other hand, was pretty much the opposite. We used to talk once in a while, never longer than a few minutes. The year ended and we didn't see much of each other. However, everytime I saw her I used to get butterflies in my stomach. 
I ended up going to a different high school than her. One day, I met her on the streets with her friends. I tried to ignore her and walk past them, cause I was scared that if I called her out she might not remember me. So, to save myself from the embarrassment I ignored her and kept walking. To my surprise she called me and asked if I remembered her, and in my head I told myself ""of course I remember you, you're the girl I had a crush on for the past few years"". As you'd expect a chickened out and asked who she was.
I still remember her saying ""Oh, ok. That's fine"" and she walked past me. I got really angry at myself and basically just sulked for the rest of the day.

190,What is your meaning of love?,"Whoa! So I’ve never talked about this, nor ever confronted myself until now. I’ve been in plenty relationships, but none of them worked out. I know my problem, but can’t seem to resolve it. 

My whole life, I’ve viewed love different, but didn’t know it until recently. I grew up with a single mom, who was a narcissist with anger issues. She told me the only reason why she screams or yells, is because she loves me. Growing up being loved in that way, all my relationships didn’t work due to the fact that my partner didn’t seem to get upset for the little things that I do. 

I’ve watched countless videos of “real” love. Videos where a man can cry comfortably describing his wife, or marriage proposals and it warms my heart because I’ve had the wrong idea about love my entire life.

I’ve made a promise to myself that next time should be different. I really wanted to express myself but didn’t know where to post it. I’m not seeking advice, but more of others views. Thanks for taking the time to read my post!",love,1542266672,JackButtHut,0,1,True,2018-11-15

Like when a lot of people thought one of my friends was dating her but they are just friends, she came up to me and said that this isn't true, she had a weird look in her eye which I don't know if it is just my imagination wanting her to like me or not. Another time me her and another couple of girls were talking about relationships and she said there is this one short guy that she would totally smash, and well my heart skipped a beat cause I'm short. She is such a nice person who is beautiful and easy to talk with. Which says a lot because I'm quiet and I can talk so easily about things with her. She also is trying to make her mysterious person/crush jealous by taking pictures with her guy friend (from earlier) which sparked the rumour that they were dating. We use to spend time together when we were younger and have started spending a bit more time because of end year parties that we go to. The shity thing is that I also still have feeling for my ex and I'm so confused and I made the mistake of listening to music and leaving myself with my thoughts.

196,I gave everything and still got dumped a day after our anniversary,"I got dumped by my bf exactly one day after what was our 2 year anniversay. Now, we had our fair share of issues in the past, all of them pretty much leading back to him: him struggling with severe mental issues along with substance/drug abuse, commitment issues aka fear of „missing out“, confused sexual urges (basically telling me he was bi and regularly watched gay porn) etc. And while all of this was obviously one big shit show, I never left, never gave up, never stopped trying to make it work. Why, I honestly don’t know. Maybe it was the poems and letters he wrote me, the heart-felt apologies he gave me or the hopeful promises that he would change, that he would get better (for us). Regardless, I stayed. To listen and understand. To give him space when he wanted and intimacy and love when he needed. I held him through his depressive/paranoid episodes, night terrors/sleep paralysis and forgave him for whatever horrible things he would do or say to me, always hoping it‘d be the last time. Always encouraging him, always believing in him and more importantly, making him believe in himself. I never thought that I had the ability to ""fix"" him. But I did believe that I could be there for him while he was fixing himself. So I tried my best to be patient and kind, while giving him all of me and all of my heart. Such silly, foolish things we do when we‘re young and in love and we think that love may actually conquer all.

And then he dumped me, right after I had told him to stop drinking (yet again). „His heart“ wasn‘t „in it“ anymore, he said. One day after our 2 year anniversay. Words can‘t describe how I felt. Anger, sadness, shame, regret - they were all there. And as if once wasn't enough, 2 weeks later he broke my heart a second time. When meeting him one last time to exchange our things (I had taken a flight and train to go see him!), he didn't even bother explaining. Didn't even have to decency or the respect to sit down with me for more than 10 minutes to give me a proper reason. Instead, he asked me for the concert tickets which I had bought for us a few weeks earlier and that we wouldn't be using anymore. If I didn't plan on going, he would. After hugging goodbye, he reminded me of them again. Told me to send them on to him. I broke down the minute I got on the train. Another week later, the third and final blow: He was back on Tinder.",love,1542283213,lostlittlehuman,2,1,True,2018-11-15

198,The synchronicity of meeting someone you can’t be with.,"I met Den 6 years ago at a party and I felt a connection right away. The energy was comfortable, as if old friends that could pick up and no time had pass at all. 
  Going backwards, I had a boyfriend at the time that ignored me the past two years and stone walked me whenever I tried to talk about the relationship. He would say ‘you are crazy.’ I never used to understand why people had affairs and judged them horribly. I thought my relationship was perfect and we could get through it all. I tried date night and he never wanted to go, it turned into fight night. Then I had my affair that I never thought I would have. 
 
 Den became apart of my friend circle quickly and he was always out with us. One day he walked me home and wanted to use my bathroom. As he was leaving he grabbed me at the doorway and French kissed me. It was the best kiss I ever received in my life. It was like I was one with the universe and completely entrenched in that present moment. No sloppy awkward lips or drool, his kiss and energy could not feel more right or perfect. He left right after and I felt horrible. I kept it a secret and chalked it up as he had  too many drinks. However, I could not stop thinking about the magical kiss but knew it was wrong. 
 My boyfriend at the time did not initiate anything sexual for over 2 years. He lost interest in me and would even make jokes how the spark was gone. I felt the entire relationship was coming down one sided as I had to try to keep the dates going, intimacy going as he hung out with his bros all the time and did his thing. People would ask where is Jared? I could not even answer because I did not even know. We were once so close and now he was so far away  and I could not even mention it without a fight.  
  I ran into Den about a week after the Kiss as he was working on a film project with a friend. Den is a photographer and videographer. I talked to him outside and told him it was wrong what happened as I have a serious relationship I am trying to work on. Den was super uncomfortable and did not say much as he does not like confrontation. Then later that night we all get drinks and I walk with Den in the City park blocks. I told him I could not stop thinking about how great the kiss was and I wanted to kiss him one more time to see if would still feel the same or if it was all in my head. We ended up kissing for a long time on a park bench. My self discipline flew out the window and Den was not only a great kisser but a super handsome exotic Spanish man. Everywhere we went girls and guys turned their heads. Then things escalated fast as I wanted to go into a parking lot and ended up giving him a bj. After this night the Pandora’s box was fully opened, there was no going back. We were emotionally, spiritually and physically connected. Everyone that saw us together just saw it. We had 100% synchronicity in so many ways. It was a relationship that started sexual but became so much deeper. Have you ever had a best friend that could almost read your mind or finish a sentence. We just could hang out and it flowed and was easy. 
 Then Den told me he was married and his wife was in Hawaii as they were on a separation. That she comes back in one month! I guess I could not be that pissed because here I am cheating on my boyfriend. So their we were entrenched in our own selfish stew of being in love rather quickly. We would try to end it but neither one of us had the self discipline to stop. The affair got deeper. We would make out and have sex everywhere but our homes. There were empty apartments in my building that they kept the door open on as remodeling and we had sex in all of them and would bathe in the large claw foot tubs. I never felt so intimate with anyone my entire life and did not even know it was possible. Our connection became an addiction and Den was my drug. I would even get super excited when he text me as I feared he would one day ghost me and break my heart. But he was equally as addicted to me. 
 Then his wife was coming home in a week. Things were rocky with Jared and I could not tell him about the affair as I was a selfish coward. I just broke up and said it was because we were not connecting how I needed, half truth. Then the same day Den broke up with me. He said he wanted to try and make things work with his wife. So there I was two breakups in one day. I realized it is for the best and I moved into a new place and literally wanted to start over. 
  About 2 weeks into my new apartment, Den comes around and it all starts back up again. So now he is the only one having an affair and I felt awful about it. This goes one for one year and I finally break it off. I end up drinking and doing cocaine to try and forget about him and even have sex with a new dude who ended up being crazy drama. I realize I am an alcoholic with codependency issues. I did not get the help I so desperately needed. I felt too good for AA and did not want to admit I had a real problem. I kept seeing different therapist but that was not good enough. 
 So what do I do, meet a sober dude on Tinder and get into a horrible abusive relationship. This man did help me with sobriety with alcoholism but then he kept tying to get me to smoke weed and I don’t even like the high of Cannabis. He did not smoke but he wanted to drug me to try to have control. I ended getting a lot of health issues from my lifestyle and ended up in the hospital from stress from all the abuse this angry man gave me.  I thought it is Karma and I deserve all these horrible things. My unhappy miserable job, my abusive dysfunctional relationships etc. I was so mad at myself for letting this all happen and not taking care of myself. 
 4 years past and I never had that kind of magical connection that I had with Den. Even though it was not right I never forgot about him. How much fun we had in all aspects of our lives. We never fought and just were always in that present moment. Den stayed in my friendship circle and he even filmed my abusive ex proposing to me in Paris. We went on a group trip and he was there. It was the worse. As we were on the train after that proposal I think I was the only one that saw Den shed a tear. I accepted that proposal because was so public and I had zero self worth at that time or ability to set any healthy boundaries. 
   
  The abusive guy and I finally broke up and I had the nerve to kick him out. My friends all wanted to turn their backs on me as they were sick of my mental health issues and poor life choices. They saw I had zero self respect and they did not respect me much either anymore. They wanted to help but they just could not watch the abuse I was doing to myself and letting it happen. I had no support. I understood I must have been a broken pathetic record that everyone wanted to ignore. They did not know and heard the same stories over and over and me not having the strength to leave. The last straw of my abuser was him telling me I was awful in bed then still trying to sleep with me. 
  So there I am broken and pathetic, beat down. I got a job I loved again and started picking up the pieces of all my power and self I gave away. 
  Then I see Den at a bday party and he still looks at me like he is in love. I ask him about it and he told me he never stopped loving me. He went on the past 4 years trying to find that connection we had again. Neither one of us Did. The 4 years found it and both went through our own versions of Hell in between all of it.
  I told him I need to take care of myself now and become the healthy version with the relationship with myself. I got completely sober, I do a 12 step program and help others now, got into Pilates and people tell me I have a fitness instructor body, I seen many therapist and got down to my core issues. Now have a job I love and great supportive friendships. 
 Den’s marriage became and open one. We dated again on and off for another year and a half. I am still in love with him but now realize I want someone that can be more then one foot in and one foot out with me. I am not sure I will ever have that kind of connection again but Den did give me hope that deep connections do exist. 
 So onward to a healthy me and the relationship with myself. Next stop.. coda meetings.

199,The places my imagination can’t even go,"As a woman, my mind constantly wonders about the future. Making plans in my head for scenarios that have yet to happen, figuring out how we will handle them. So many different places my mind wonders.... kids, vacations, old age, grandkids. 

But one place my mind ALWAYS comes to a screeching halt is the thought of not loving you. Divorce isn’t even a world I can imagine. It makes us so much different than the ones of the past. Thoughts of breakup and deciding who gets what, how I’ll handle money and daily activities alone.... these things just aren’t even imaginable with you.

I can’t imagine a world where I don’t love you, and I don’t want to. My mind has wondered to crazy things of how I would handle being a widow, but never a divorcé. It just makes the world not work right. 

There would be no amicable situation raising kids, cause we are going to do it together. There would be no issues with living situations, because I’m going to be waking up with you beside me. 

The realization that life separate is just not even fathomable hit me this morning on my way to work. My brain just can’t compute not being in love with you, or you with me. It’s comforting but still odd my imagination can’t even go there. When it can travel to a world of the apocalypse, or zombies, or complete homelessness. But not loving you?

About 2 months ago I started therapy and and it's helped me tremendously. My head feels clearer and I've actually woken up feeling good. Well, following that up, I experienced something I've never felt before, and it all was in a dream. I dreamt that I was with a woman and we we're having an amazing time. Things got a bit hot and heavy, as it is a dream, and we started having sex, but not right away like a shitty porno or something along those lines. We were just happy, and laughing a lot, and just enjoying each other's company. We even got in the shower and started to kiss and all I could remember was just a lot of hugging and kissing and laughing. I woke up with a feeling I've never felt before, it wasn't just an urge to have sex, or just a simple crush, it felt so much more driven. It was a flood of emotions that all felt so good and so right. The only question I could ask now is if this is what love feels like?",love,1542301996,dota_2_doc,1,1,True,2018-11-15

203,"Dear Ken,","I love you, to me you have completely move on romantically and I understand that. I step over my boundaries lately. I had hope there was something left of the ""US"" the hanging out watching shows, and just cuddling and the hope I can find the comfort I once did with you as I did multiple times, specially now with current events. I realize that comfort and relationship is been dead now for some time. I have been very selfish with my needs and emotions and I can't speak to you since I'm very emotional right now, I'm writing this to help me not step my boundaries with you. I'm sorry for the distress and problems I cost you. I will move on and respect you and only smile at you when I see you. You have been trying to be my friend and be understanding of my current situation and for that I'm grateful, I'm hoping I can be the friend to you. I notice that my current situation has made you uncomfortable, since is problematic and emotional.  I'm reminding myself to not look for you emotionally anymore as I write this.  There is so much I would like to say to you in person that I can't with out involving emotions and tears which you hate to hear.

I'm scare about the James situation, with what he has done and the accusation and investigation that is going on. When I was 12 my mom friend approached me and asked me ""If I have ever kissed an older man he was 35 at the time, he grabbed my hand and showed a me sign man do when a man wants to have sex which is, holding your hand while rubbing their thumb on your palm. WTF right? There is code or sign to tell a woman you want SEX? anyways he grabbed my leg and I freaked out and started screaming I asked him to stop at the nearest gas station. Mom was in the other car. We were going to a church function I think. My mom and her friend asked me to stop being so dramatic, and that nothing happened,  I forgot about that situation Ken until now. Guess what! It happened again a couple of years later with my stepfather, he approached me the same way when I was 16, on my way to school it was the same approached. Asked me ""if I ever kissed an older man"" this time it was different I despise him, so I told him if he didn't shut up until he dropped me off at school I was going to talk to my counselor and say he was sexually harassing me, he quickly turn around and said ""What me? No that is disgusting"" I'm just trying to help you. But I knew his intentions from the beginning, I've bee there before. I told my mom about it and she also ignore it, only to divorce him later on from cheating, and mental abuse.  I thought it was just my luck I came across these type of behavior. Finding out the father of my kids did this to my sister at the age of 12 as well, last week has left very heart broken and confused about life. Our daughter was being born and he did this around the time of her birth, and the story starts with ""Have you ever kissed an older man""

This is just beginning of what I would like to share with you,

204,10 years now. 10 years to come.,"It has been 10years since I met my first love . This 10 years now,  i had a few relationships. Dated many. Went out with even more partners. But nobody gets me like she did. Today, we ain't connected in any way. She blocked me on every social media ever existed including messaging apps because of how I will drop her text every now and then.(I know it is for the best for us) To tell her about my day and what is bothering to me.  Kinda like making a wish, betting on the chance that she will turn back one day.  

Once, 2 years ago. I was hospitalised. She said she don't mind coming over the next morning. After learning that she is attached, I told her not to come because idw complicate things for her. It was the right thing to do though I really wanted to fcking see her badly. 

I recalled I once had a dream, 6 months ago. That we were back together. I hugged her so tight for so long. Because it finally happened. By the time I woke up, I found my face wet. I was actually tearing while I was dreaming. Somehow, I knew. I was dreaming.  But yeah, I tried togo back go sleep asap, in hopes of continuing the dream like you know.  How our nightmare tends to resume..

Even today, I will drop everything just for a date with her. A trip, a movie, a dinner, a walk or even a call. 4 years ago, we went to catch a horror film. Conjuring/insidious. I remembered how she grab my arm when the jump scare happened. It felt like we still had it. She only agreed go watch with her because I told her I have no one to watch with. 

Now, I no longer wants her to be with me. Because I know she deserves so much more than me. I miss her every now and then but that is the price of love. I don't regret knowing her. My only regret is not giving her my best when I had her.  It is a lesson learnt. The next time I ever have that chance again, I will definitely give her my best. 

I don't blame her for how dark and painful my world have became since she left years ago. I only pray that her world(all the readers here too) is a better place.

To the readers, I know this is stupid. To be holding onto someone who have already moved on. But love is beautiful the way it is and I understand where you are coming from.

To the broken hearted ones, cry as much as you want, be it alone or with your loved ones. Embrace the pain, acknowledge to yourself how much you miss a certain someone. At least we all had that happiness once. Let that be a reason for you to smile again. 

To anyone that happened to recognise my ID, please respect my confidentiality. Let's not cause unnecessary anxiety. 

To love, is to want the best for another person (partner, family, friends likewise). It is not about possession. It is about the intention.

To the love of my life, I'm still around if you ever need someone by yourself. I pray for your well-being every now and then. This is my commitment to my fairy tale. To be here, till the end of the world. 

Love is painful but it is much more beautiful.
I will choose to love than to be loved. Anytime.

It has been 1-2 years since we have seen each other and just yesterday and decided to come by. He had dinner with my family and talked with my parents and I can tell they both like him. Well especially my mom. XD But wow it was getting late we were supposingly watching Meg. Then you kept falling asleep in my bed and you are such a deep sleeper. It's funny how you had your leg up on my lap as I sat in my desk chair. Your foot just kept twitching. But it's cute how you kept rolling my chair between your legs and your hands were cold so you just stuck your hands into the pocket of my hoodie. And were basically hugging me tightly. You would rest your head on my shoulder and just started biting my ear. I dont know why but even though it was ticklish, I still enjoyed it. But you have a girlfriend and friends dont do that. Either way I mostly enjoyed how you were simply hugging my tightly or how you would hold my hand. It's as if you didn't want to loose me. Then you had to go and I kept trying to get you to leave.

216,Letter to my Soulmate,"Every waking moment of every single day, I can’t help but think about you. I look at other women and compare what I dream of you being like to them in order to remind myself that you’re the only one I need in my life. It’s a constant struggle for me, I’m constantly wrestling to keep out of the skirts and mouths of the yearning women around me. I’m 19 years old and have never had sex before, my peers call being a virgin “embarrassing” but I take pride knowing that I’m saving myself for you. 
I’m growing physically, mentally and spiritually everyday, beginning to understand myself as well as the world around me. I pray that I grow in these ways rapidly in hopes of being ready when I finally get to meet you. I often pray for your health, safety, happiness, relationship with the Lord and those around you on top of many more things. I look forward to finally meeting you but until then, I’ll continue to better myself. I love you more than words can express and long to finally be with you....

217,Don't Know How to Help my Partner with Anxiety Issues.. Need help,"I've been seeming to have this problem for a long while. Let me explain further...

I am completely with my soulmate. I know it. I have never known a soul like his could exist and he loves me like no other. He loves me for my flaws and helps me learn to love myself. I have anxiety due to my father abandoning me and emotionally abusive past relationships, but he loves me like no other and makes me feel at peace, which I never feel. The only problem is that he, also, has anxiety but I don't know how to help him. He can randomly get in moods where he feels that he never does anything right and has anxiety attacks. They're random, which many anxiety attacks are, and once they occur I try to do all I can to help him. I will tell him how much I love him and also try to be rational with him and tell him that what he's feeling isn't the truth. But it feels like no matter the measure I take, it never seems to comfort him. He likes to have a schedule and a plan for everything, but once it doesn't go how he wants it to, he will have an anxiety attack and it seems as though I can't help him. I love him so much and I want to make sure he's okay. It breaks my heart to see him like that. Another thing that happens during these anxiety episodes is that if I tell him to breathe or how much I love him, he will keep repeating ""please don't hate me."" It makes me so upset to see him feel like he ruins everything and that everyone hates him, especially me. I love him so much and I need help. ",love,1542386929,kyliegoudy,0,1,True,2018-11-16
218,Why do so many people badmouth their partners?,"It can’t be a high standard to want a partner who won’t talk badly about you with their peers. I don’t mean this in a sense of, say, the relationship having turbulence and someone needs to talk with outside parties about it – which is fine. What I’m referring to are more superficial things. 

I’ve heard people jab their long-term committed partners (usually preceding an eventual breakup) for everything from the way she dresses to how prude she is, to her ugly decoration skills (that was referring to me btw, lol) to how sensitive she is, to a lack of sex (and afterwards crudely starting to consider pursuing other women *before* communicating or breaking up). And, yes, it’s 99% of the time been targeted at women, though the speaker has been mostly (but certainly not all) men. 

It’s all so common and *very disheartening*, and someone doesn’t necessarily have to be a completely bad or evil person to be this way. I’m sure there are plenty of people who either don’t do this in the first place or who can be communicated with not to, but it’s just so prevalent. I can’t stand to be the butt of a mean joke or an uncalled for jab by my partner, including behind my back. I don’t know why so many of us think it’s okay to do.

224,A year of silence for a storm of bittersweet,"First time posting something like this but I just have to ramble at someone.

I have been crushing on a coworker for well over a year and have been in love with her for half of that. After a night of watching one of the most terrible movies in existence and getting us wined up, she confessed that she's got a crush on me and has had a ""low-key crush"" on me for about a year as well. I'm about to move to a different job and she's going to move out of state within five months. I had a panic attack for the first time in years and couldn't stop pacing around her house with my arms, legs, and lips going numb from hyperventilating and my heart was breaking and rejoicing at the same time. She held me and helped calmed me down, we kissed, and she's been only slightly less distant than normal coworker level since. I don't even know what she wants out of any of this but she told me in the middle of me being on the verge of tears not to get too attached.

This is possibly the most bittersweet moment in my life yet and I can't stop feeling a terrible, immense sadness and heartbreak in the midst of magnificent elation and joy.

Whenever a mutual crush has been declared with anyone else in the past, the other person and I have wanted to be near and with each other as often and as long as possible (within reason, of course) but she just seems to be keeping distance and not wanting to hang out anymore than before the revelation.

I'm confused but I don't pretend to know how anyone else works and I know that we all have our fears, expectations, hopes, and ideas of how relationships, new or old, work. I'm just crushed more than anything.

I don't necessarily want advice or anything, just to share and get it out of my shaky chest and lighten my cognitive load.

With much r/love,

225,To the girl I can’t stop thinking about,"Some time has passed since I first heard about you, since I dreamt about you. I thought it was over, that I managed to forget you, but your ghost always came back. Each time something happens in my life, thinking about you help me to overcome this ordeal, like I can’t manage to overcome it by myself anymore.

The first time I discovered you was because of what you accomplished. It was something incredible I dream to do. However I have to admit that I was mostly focused on your beauty. Despite some bad pictures of you, you’re the most charming girl I’ve ever seen. Your blue eyes are both wonders and your smile warms my heart. You’re so elegant, simple, not superficial and feminine. Besides, even if you look younger than your age, you looks like a woman, the kind I’ve always dreamed of.

However I firstly didn’t think about you as a crush. Maybe I didn’t have the time to think about that stuff or maybe the fact I never believed in love was the problem. Nevertheless, at the end of my recent difficulties, you became my fantasy. Then I got more infatuated each day because of what I was discovering about you. We have so much in common : our personality, our passions, ... Moreover I like the fact you’re older than me (so probably mature) and brilliant. I love all of that and, for the first time in my life, I started to think that I could have found someone who can understand me, a confidant, a purpose who can bring me something more, who can make me feel like being with myself without being alone. I even thought it was fate (only because the sum of our birth date is equal to the day I discovered you). I spent all my holidays thinking about you, trying to forget you. However, each night, a simple thought of you helped me to sleep. My sleep cycle was totally disrupted. Sometimes I didn’t want to wake up because I wanted to continue to dream of you. My heart was beating, I was suffocating. Talking about you makes me smile or blushes my cheeks. I wanted to cuddle you, to hold your hand, to kiss you and you to do the same. Sexual stuff wasn’t interesting me anymore, unless it was with you. Thus I didn’t manage to forget you : it was the opposite.

I finally decided to contact you. I was writing my letter each day and, each day, I was seeing the chance to meet you growing. However I was thinking I was probably crazy. I talked about it to some relatives, to some friends. They firstly encouraged me but then discouraged me and made fun of me. However I believed in my success. For the first time in my life and despite my inexperience in love, I was believing in my chance, believing in me, believing in a change and was proud of myself. I sent you that mail and was waiting for an answer. Even if you didn’t want to meet me, I would have been happy if you see how much you motivated and inspired me. However the answer wasn’t what I expected. Your assistant answered and it was humiliating.

I then started to get in a cycle where I forget you, then think about you. I finally managed to find a way to contact you and wanted to try another time. However, that same day, I discovered that you were probably married. I laughed a lot, like the time I failed my exams, thinking that another time life was giving me a test, that I didn’t have chance. However, like in most of my problems, I didn’t manage to find the lesson.

Now I just feel ashamed and ridiculous. How did I fall in love with a girl I don’t even know ? Me, the wise and mature guy (like everybody like to say), I did that. Are you a dream ? Or are you real ? I was saying to myself that just being friend with you or meeting you was enough, but the reality is that I wanted you so much, I wanted a dream so much. Sometimes I didn’t like the way you were talking, or when you didn’t smile or your investment in your work. However I overcame that, thinking it was making you more real, more human. But the reality is that I tried to avoid who you are. Are you like I imagined ? And what type of man do you like ?

Finally I managed to forget you. However you motivated me to invest myself in what you did. I firstly was disappointed but I now see the benefits from it and I thank you for that. However, as one of my friends reminded me recently, I’m closer to you than before and I’ll probably meet you someday. What will I do if that happens ? It’s terrible because I’m restarting to think about you, hoping that I could meet you one day. I try to avoid my life, try to imagine myself with you someday and I know it’ll make me suffer because I have no chance with you. I even don’t know if I’ll like you. I’m also understanding that I never forgot you : dreaming about other girls was just dreaming about you and imagining ourselves friends was just an excuse to think about you.

I’m sorry, really sorry for doing that. You don’t know me and maybe if that was the case, you wouldn’t like me or you would make fun of me. I just felt that you could have filled the blank in my life, the lack of love, the lack of success. Everybody think my life is incredible, that I’m brilliant, cool and mature. However I just wanted a life with you, the only thing I ever desire with freedom and happiness. Thus I hope that someday I would meet you and that we would enjoy talking together. Thanks for making me believe in love, even if I don’t believe in love without you.",love,1542409942,JyVe78,0,1,True,2018-11-16
226,I need a gift suggestion for my dearly beloved~,"So I'm a little stuck. I only see my girlfriend once a month and currently get less than 30usd per week.

I want to gift her something really special that she will remember forever.

She loves Nintendo, Splatoon and Anime. She sadly has clinically diagnosed depression and social anxiety. She's 16, and I'm 17.

The gift isnt a Christmas, anniversary or birthday gift. I just want so do something nice for her since she has supported me and been my best friend for over 2 years. Shes stuck with me through so much hardship and loves me for who I am.

Thats why I want to do something special.

I can't take her out anywhere or spend any time with her alone because of our parents.

I was thinking of giving her a box with hand written letters for any emotion she may feel.

If shes angry, there will be a letter to calm her down. If shes sad, there will be a letter to cheer her up. Etc...

I want to do more than this for her though. Have you guys ever made your beloved something? If so what was it? What do you recommend?",love,1542412743,Soulzsy,0,1,True,2018-11-16

228,"i dont want to lose her, i dont know if I WANT to move on...","Last time i saw her at school, my fucking stomach dropped, i spammed her on insta, and scared her (which i didnt mean to do), we ghosted each other for two months, until she came up to school, i guess she had a day off, and since her mom works at my school. We became good friends in my 7th grade year, idk when, but we did become good friends, when i started to like her, was at a party, she came up to me, asking when i was getting my new guitar, that made my fucking heart melt, i actually felt cared, and appreciated for in middle school, since bullying has been a problem all my life, she was my outlet, my everything, my day and night, sun and moon. Since i was in 7th and she in 8th at the time, she was getting ready for high school, which im doing now, and close to the end of the year, she got out earlier then everybody else for the year, and every time she came up, she came to my homeroom to talk and help, thats where i recognized there was still good in the world, good people (which there are, im just saying in middle school) On the last day i think, or close to it, i think it was, i was walking out of church (private catholic) and she was standing there, called MY name, and gave ME a FUCKING HUG, holy shit, i felt great. She made me feel protected and welcomed, and i don't want to lose her.

So as of recent, we've been talking, last time i saw her was a today, but i saw her last week or so, as soon as i walked up those stairs and pass those doors last week, i saw her, my fucking stomach started hurting, and i was shaking i was that scared, later that morning i saw her downstairs during art, cause we were taking pictures, and her mom is the pre k teacher, and i just waved, thats all, i didnt want to scare her, she looked happy to see me tbh, not mad or scared, or wanting to go away, i was gonna say sorry, but i bitched out, and it would've been kinda awkward. My counselor has been helping me with this, figuring out what i should do, and i asked to talk to her, and she said write an apology, and wait, i did, three days pass by, tuesday-friday, nothing, saturday, nothing, sunday, something. This was at 9 o clock at night, so i was tired, as SOON as i saw that friend request, i started to shake, i didn't want anything to do with her at that moment, she caused me to lose sleep, and make my stomach hurt, which isn't healthy, if she saw me and go up to me and said hi if she came up to school, i would've told her to fuck off tbh, but i didnt. She sent me close to 4-5 sentences, saying high school is busy, and saying i cant spam her all the time, and that she understands that i didn't mean to hurt her feelings, i went to reddit, and made the fastest post i ever made, and just said omg, thx sm, and thats all. She's fine with talking to me, i'm fine with her, idk what to do if i want to try and move on her, even though she is dating someone, just as friends tbh. i dont know if i want to move on or not, to ignore someone i love, what do i do?

I admit that this post may seem like i'm an obsessive incel which im not, i just messed up, accepted my mistake. Im not a stalker, i didnt mean to hurt her feelings

I saw yesterday, and she was friendly and said hi, i didn't mind to see her actually, no one came up to me like they did last week telling me she was here, but i don't want to lose her

YOU were MY soulmate, making ME happy, making ME WELCOMED, and i love you, i care about you, i dont want lose you

""No i dont want to be your best friend 'cause im in love with you""?)

233,I'll try to explain what i didn't in the past post here,"K, imma start where i left it,   


She and his boyfriend had troubles, 'cause he was talking bad of her at his back  
And i really was mad when that happened but i couldn't do anything, Before that she had more troubles with his boyfriend and i took that opportunity and told her that i was ""In love with her"" and she did take it in the best way possible, we didn't ended up in a relationship but finally she knew that, our friends ""Relationship"" was going perfect nothing was awkward between us, but then the problem of her Boyfriend talking trash at his back came up, and she didn't knew what to do so i tried to cheer her up and i think i did, after that he broke up with him and now here i am telling y'all this, The point of posting this is that finally i was about to forget about her but when she texted me that (What was up with me) idk why but i started just feeling like i couldn't just ""Forget"" her, and i dont know what to do now.  


Now all that i just wrote can be told quick.  


Im trying to ""forget"" her but i cant, she is back with his ex now, she will notice if something is happening to me and ask me about it, i will just say that nothing is happening to me even when she knows that something is happening to me, She will feel bad for me (Which i know 'cause she already told me that, and i don't want her to worry about me) And things will be awkward between us again.  


The only 2 possible solutions that i can think are  


1 Just wait to go to High school (Maybe you are thinking how im not already in High school when im 15, and the answer is that in Latin America first grade of High school is 3rd grade of secondary school) 'cause she will go to a different school and try to ""forget"" about her   


2 Just wait till they broke again (If they do), give her some time and try to be in a relationship with her  


Pd: I already talked with her about us in a relationship and she told me we can try it  


Like i said in the past post maybe this will sound dumb to some people but Hey, im 15 there's much for me to live and i dont know what to do rn, and probably this isn't the best place to ask for help but at least i can try to.

236,Why I will NEVER Open My Heart to Love Again - “Take Care Until next Time 😊”,"I couldn’t find the “nobody gives a crap” sub reddit so I guess I’ll post this here. I just poured my heart &amp; soul into an email (posted below with names redacted) to someone I care about deeply &amp; basically got a “that’s great you’re feeling that, I’m too busy for a friendship, take care until next time” message back. 

I’m crushed. I was feeling so lost until I found her. My feelings were so incredibly powerful I was certain she was the one for me. I really put my heart out there &amp; her text message back put a dagger in it. After taking that gut punch &amp; crying for a bit I figured I need to text back something so I just texted back a thumbs up emoji. 

This is why people stop believing in love. I meant every single word I wrote. It came directly from my heart. Why is it so hard to find other genuine, authentic souls? I guess there aren’t many of us left. Feeling pretty lonely now. And a little sad. Life really sucks, but I thought maybe this might be the one time it didn’t. I truly believed she must be having the same feelings (and I’m usually very intuitive when it comes to this). I was wrong. I don’t feel bad about telling her though because it’s all the truth &amp; it came straight from my heart &amp; soul. Guess that’s what makes this all the more painful. 

The good news is I get to “take care until next time” so that’s awesome! 👍

Love does not “conquer all”. Whoever wrote that can kick rocks! 

Basically the universe led me to her just so i could get my heart ripped out. 

I’ll shut TF up now because I’m certain nobody cares. Just had to vent because I have nobody to talk to about this &amp; its tearing me up inside. I’m used to the pain of depression, but this adds a whole new level of sadness. My heart is shattered into a thousand pieces right now. I never reach out to people but I truly thought this was the one person I could. I felt it in my heart or I wouldn’t have wrote it. This isn’t some game to me. This world is really brutal sometimes, but I guess I’m getting numb to it.
I pour my heart out &amp; get “take care until next time” back. Unbelievable. Love sucks!!!

So I guess that’s it - but I’ll make sure to take care until next time though!!!



Here’s my email if anyone cares: 

*****a,

I don’t even know where to begin since I’m still experiencing all of this on a daily basis, but the change you’ve helped bring about within me is too amazing not to share. I’m not usually this open, but something in my soul told me to write this to you...

I guess I’ll start with the day we met. Before meeting you that day, I was happy to see a delivery pop up out by my old house. I hadn’t driven out there in awhile &amp; missed it. Little did I know I was about to meet someone that would change my life &amp; touch my soul. 

The truth is I’ve had a crush on you from the second we first met. I could feel my heart begin beating faster as I introduced myself to you for the first time. I felt an instant connection to you that day, but because of my situation I wasn’t in position to do anything about it. That being the case, I talked myself out the thought of reaching out to you. More than a few times actually. But no matter what I told myself, I could never really get thoughts of you out of my head. I’d think about you from time to time no matter how much I tried not to. 

Now, I must admit, there is nothing I look forward to more than seeing you. It’s been that way for me since we first met. Seeing your name pop up as my next order always makes me smile. Every time we see each other I grow fonder of you, despite my best attempts to fight it. 

Fast forward to the last time I came out to see you, when we hung out &amp; smoked a bowl. I don’t often open up to people the way I do with you, but you are so incredibly easy to talk to. It makes me want to tell you everything &amp; talk to you about anything. I can’t explain it. I’m still trying to understand the profound affect you’ve had on me. Somehow you’ve touched my heart &amp; my soul. Sitting with you that day felt like home. I’ve felt nothing but love for you ever since. Which is truly incredible given that I’ve spent the better part of the last few years not feeling much of anything- sometimes even trying desperately to feel again. But somehow you’ve changed all that. I don’t know how, but you have. I can feel again. It’s changed me in ways I’m still struggling to put in words (despite my best efforts). It’s like you flipped a switch inside me. I’ve only felt this way one other time in my life &amp; I honestly never expected to feel it again. I had completely forgot how it felt. After years of neglect my heart has awoken &amp; is asking me to listen to it again. It’s given me the spark I needed to continue writing. I’d been blocked for some time, but now I’m finding my voice again. I want to let you know how grateful I am. Truly grateful! 

I know this probably makes no sense. I certainly can’t explain it. But I can’t deny it anymore either. I think you are amazing in every way imaginable. I think about you everyday. You have already made an indelible mark on my soul &amp; earned a permanent place in my heart no matter what happens between us. Every ounce of my soul feels like I owe you a debt of gratitude. I want to pay that debt forward. That’s what’s in my heart. I want to bring peace, love, and happiness into your life in whatever form that takes. I want to be there for you to ease your pain when you’re in need the way you’ve helped ease mine. You are an incredible human being ***a!

I also fully respect &amp; understand the circumstances. Ultimately I put your happiness above all else and would never get in the way of that in any way. I only want to bring positive vibes into your life the way you’ve brought them into mine. I’m totally cool being friends. I love talking to you. I’m grateful just to have met you. I wanted to say thank you &amp; let you know I couldn’t be happier that we met. I look forward to catching up with you again soon.

Have a great day! 

-(Me)


I’m not gonna post her whole reply but this last paragraph is verbatim &amp; it cuts like a knife. 

Her reply to me opening my heart &amp; soul?

“I wish I had more time to hang out as friends, but I have an immense amount of things happening. You deserve happiness &amp; I hope you pursue it daily. Take care until next time.”

Dagger. She ripped my heart out, showed it to me, and crushed it. 

And “I hope you pursue your happiness daily”? Um, what do you THINK that email was about???

I’ll NEVER do anything like this again. No matter how sure I am I don’t ever want to get burned like this again. “Take care until next time” right after telling me how busy she is basically is telling me to F off. I’m not a complete fool (although I feel like one right now). My guess is I’ll never hear from her again. And I sure AF won’t contact her again after this blatant rejection. Message received- I don’t mean ANYTHING to you. 

It wasn’t supposed to end like this. How was my heart SO WRONG? 

Don’t mind me while I go back to feeling nothing &amp; while slipping back into oblivion.

259,Feeling foolish and devastated,"Let me tell you my story 

I met a girl online and we exchanged numbers and we were chatting many hours a day . She was very pretty but what made her unique that she was a nerd and crazy about science ,games , documentaries .we were so similar I was falling for her .We were discussing about universe , space time . She was giving hints that she liked me too. She was sending pictures with cat who she called her son. We even started calling sweet names to each other. And I asked her are we in love? and she told me she felt different with me, she had never felt like that before and we started chatting like lovers . And one day she told me (on Google Hangouts laptop). That she was robbed (her puruse and iPhone ) by a guy and she  is in trauma and shaking . I tried to calm her down I called her on Hangout  but she  said she can't hear what I am saying and I was also not able to listen her voice . She goes to police to file complaint . And I get a call from the guy who supposedly robbed her he started saying vulgar things and told me that he will rape her . I was so afraid for her I even tried to contact police in her country .But one thing that doesn't made sense to me how did he unlocked her iPhone . After filling police complaint she came back on Google Hangout and I told her to video call me she said okay then here comes the black screen and noise as sound .and I heard a dog barking behind her  which raised my suspicion . Failed to connect on video call . I asked her that she has a cat but why am i hearing a barking dog behind her. She told me she doesn't know why all this is happening with her and told me she is crying and nobody is there for her . I told her that she is faking and she acted pretty and helpless and asked me why I am not believing her after all that we have shared . I told her I just want to see you live in a video . She said she doesn't know why her webcam not working . I told her I have filed an online complaint against that guy in her country . She said she is so lucky . But I said I know you are faking"" you and that guy are same person"" . She wrote in a very saddistic  way that she will buy new phone tommorow and will video call me  to clear my doubts. Hmm but I was thinking if she is not faking she needs me at this moment whole night I wasn't able to sleep well I woke up I messaged her ""hey"" no reply came,  I was just gonna tell her that if she is real I am here for her . I was feeling sad and it was so painful not able to help her but instead of helping her I said her that she was  fake. My heart was squeezing . Then I tried  reverse image search of the pictures she shared  nothing came up , tried different websites even face recogintion one no result came . Googled her phone number and used different software to detect her true identity but no success . After many hours of research I land up on a website which showed the Instagram  of similar looking people to image and voila I found the girl . Hmm i text her on Instagram telling that someone using her identity to scam people . I didn't get  back any reply till now and I think I wouldn't get because that pretty  nerdy girl with whom I fell in love looks like some model totally a different personality and she has even posted a picture today looking very happy . And the pictures that guy shared were all present there and some were very old ones which she (he) had sent me saying she is going out for party . GODDAMNIT that guy made a perfect personality, a pretty girl living alone in a big city who is nerdy but well organized , hardworking, goes to her college and to gym to stay healthy , gives tution to support herself and the most important she likes you and thinks that we are similar and special . I AM FEELING DEVASTATED AND SO STUPID BOTH at the same time lolllllllllllll. And feeling like there is hole in my chest where heart is present and no  other woman can fill it.

 Now when i see that girls real Instagram I feel like we met in different world or in different lives  or in different times . And in this world she doesn't recognize me anymore . 

I am alone right now nobody to talk to that's why I shared here and lol I know I am stupid to believed such a shit .

263,Love should go both ways,"So here’s a fun story, the thing I (17 M) have wanted more than anything in the world is to feel unconditional love for someone who feels the same way towards me but here’s the problem.

Pretty much all of my relationships have just not worked, I don’t have any bad blood with any of my ex’s or anything because when we broke up the feelings were always mutual. The trouble is I was too young to know what love actually was when I was in actual relationships but as soon as I realised what unconditional love was, my love life went to complete shit. Either I’ve fallen for someone who doesn’t feel the same way or someone has fallen for me who I just saw as a friend.

Thanks to this I’ve been able to get over rejection fairly quickly because I know how it feels for someone to be on that end of the spectrum but the fact that this keeps on happening pisses me off.

Maybe I’m just attractive to the sorts of people who aren’t my type or maybe I’m just too picky.

Anyway I have no idea where I’m going with this so I should probably just shut up now 😂. I know this is probably a common thing that happens and I know that one day I’ll find ‘the one’ but I thought this would be a good thing to get off my chest and I feel that the best course of action is to just create an account on tinder if I’m not in a relationship by the age of 18, thanks fellow Redditors for listening to my rant which is really not going to affect much in the grand scheme of things, but hey I’m a teenager leave me alone 😂",love,1542578438,TrueMythic,2,1,True,2018-11-18

I didn’t think my heart was ready to move on and open up to someone new. I was looking for someone to replace him, but no one was right. 
When i let my guard down, you suddenly came and now you won’t leave my head. I’m so scared that I will be heartbroken again, but what if this is the one time I won’t? What if I needed to go through that heartbreak to meet you?

267,Should love be about who they are or how they make you feel?,"Personally, I've been wondering this for a while. Do I love my boyfriend because he gives me attention and affection or because he is smart and funny? These things also overlap sometimes though because the fact that he is funny also means that he gives me attention by trying to make me laugh. 

I guess I kind of feel like most people who think they are in love feel that way because the person treats them sweetly and stuff but real unconditional love is when you can just look at that person doing their own things and be like ""wow look at them go I really love and care about them."" 

Someone once described this concept to me as ""fish love"" vs real love. you say you love fish because its what you need and it gives your body sustenance and makes you feel good and helps you live a better life but you wouldn't love fish if you didn't have it and if you couldn't eat it and all that. You don't want the fish to succeed and be happy and nothing about that fish, in particular, makes you love it aside from what it can do for you.

Where we were children playing together

I think love is a beautiful thing, and there is a lot of aggressive focus on the negative aspects of a break up that makes its sensitive aftermath unnecessarily shameful.

280,"Am I psycho or in love? (Me F/24, Him M/25)","TL;DR: Been secretly in love with someone for years, would like to send a meaningful but anonymous bday gift. Creepy or sweet?

Ok, sigh, here goes.

I've been secretly in love with someone (lets call him Ben) for the last couple of years. We don't speak much...I kind of just love him from afar. But, the times that we did speak/hangout, it was for hours at a time...we talked about everything. I mean really deep childhood trauma, who am I, who do I want to be kind of stuff. Hence the love on my end. Anyway, the last time I saw Ben was a few months ago. I finally worked up the courage to ask him to hangout as more than friends...and it was...bad. I was so nervous... I drank soooo much tequila to try and relax...huge fatal mistake...Honestly, I dont remember ANYTHING. Not even our first kiss &lt;/3. I hope blackout me enjoyed that moment. The next day, I texted an apology, joked that he should block me and cried all day and night. He of course never texted again LOL! &lt;\3 ugh :')

Fast forward 2 months. Ben's birthday is coming up (same day as my dad's? yup.) and....this is the creepy part....I want to send him an anoynymous bday gift. Truly I dont want him to know it was me. 

Here's why. So, during one of our heart to hearts, we agreed that Mark Twain is our fav classic American writer and joked that he is the Jon Stewart of old. I recently read Innocents Abroad and I would love to share it with him. I dont want anything else..just for him to have it.

AM I A PSYCHO IS THAT THE CREEPIEST THING EVER???? Please drop a comment and lets me know.

Thank you all &lt;3

281,Why do I always fall for women who are not at all interested in me?,"The story of my life, since I was 15 (now 40), every time I had a major crush or strong feelings for someone they were not interested in me not even a bit. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME? It's f\*\*\*ing killing me. 

I'm someone who never had issues dating. Between everyone I've seriously dated, had one night stands or short relationships with, there might be about 36 women in my entire life. Recently there have been two beautiful smart and kind girls who were interested in me but I said no cause my heart was not there (just to show that I have no problem dating if I want to).

I have thought about all possibilities, IS IT ME? At this point after lots of self examination, I'd say not really. I'm not dumb (I have a PhD), I'm athletic, in good physical shape and I take good care of myself, I have a well-paid job. Am I kind? I don't know but everyone around me  complements me a lot on my kindness. Am I good looking? I don't know, but the majority of my close friends are girls and tell me that I am. Maybe they are just be nice... In short, If I have to describe myself; I'm an average person... 

I have already been in love 3 times in long term relationships where the feeling was mutual. The last of them lasted 11 years. These were relationships in which there were some initial interest and little by little turned into love over time. 

However, I have NEVER dated someone that I had a major crush on. Why is it that every single time is a failure? It makes me feel so undesirable , so worthless.  The men these girls choose are so inferior to them and I don't understand why. These are highly educated women who went for guys that barely finished high school, low class, and treat them less that what they deserve. I feel so pathetic to say this but, WHY NOT ME? These were girls that I would dedicate my life to make them happy if they were with me. 

This has caused me major depression throughout a good part of my romantic life. At my age I feel like I'm  15 again and it makes me feel like a big looser.  ",love,1542663051,Nemo-666,4,1,True,2018-11-19

To the homophobes, I hope one day you realise your God doesn't tolerate hate, but will accept you into His/Her Kingdom anyway.

To the men who believe women are inferior, I hope one day you realise there would be no you without a womb.

To the Islamaphobes, I hope you realise one day that Islam is a religion of peace that was attacked by the white West for its goods, and while 99% of the religion forgive you, only 1% turned on you. 

To the predators, I'm sorry for whatever family member messed you up enough to believe the opposite sex deserve it too. 

To the skinny people, I'm sorry that the heavier ones gawk at you not realising you also feel pain.

To the heavier people, I'm sorry that the skinny girls make fun of you for having some meat on your bones.

To the ""disabled"" I'm sorry the ""perfect"" feel sorry for you, and some want to rid your genes from humanity. You are wonderful.

To the flat earthers, I'm sorry you have to rebel this way when there is so much more to the universe, you just have to open your eyes.

To the Nazis, who are mostly Christian, I hope you realise it's going to take more than begging to be accepted by your God, who is Jewish.

To the white elite, I hope one day you realise that without the working man you would not be CEO of anything.

And to Donald Trump, the world is fucked. The world does not need a President in 2018 who does not believe in climate change, supports white supremacy and tries to kill millions of Americans on cheap healthcare.

He even dated one of my friends and i was scared to tell her because I was scared she would be upset but she's crushing on someone else but unimportant. He has the deepest bluest eyes Iv ever seen and they have little green specs in them and in the right lighting you can see brown specs too. And everyone else points out he has acne but fuck all of that he makes me so giggly inside and I immediately become this comedian when he's around. Everyone says he weird for only wearing long sleeves and pants every day but again fuck that. He's self-conscious and it makes me so angry. He thinks he's too skinny but sorry for being repetitive but fuck that. He's perfect in every god damned way. We've hugged before and just the feeling of his arms around e for the few seconds it happened I felt like I was floating. I felt his heart beating and I felt like I was high on every drug possible. And even when he's being sarcastic and quoting some stupid joke we share I see him smile and my heart becomes this rock in my chest and I can't help but smile. When he laughs I forget everything else around me. When he jokes I just lose my mind. I can't help it. HIs blond hair that's just a little too long and he's constantly moving it out of his face makes me go insane. I have the urge to just reach out and push behind him. Just to touch him. But the last I've heard he likes another girl that's taller than me and prettier than me and is always perfect. And even when she has a bad hair day she looks amazing and she puts her head in his lap and plays with hair. And I just watch from afar and wish hopelessly that one day that would be me.

Aaaaand dumbass me from back then didn't do anything about it. We were in the same band, she'd been in my house and me in hers and we met each other's parents. But nothing happened, cause I was too scared to do anything about it. In May 2018 we started meeting up at her house a lot to practice but the feelings were gone. May was a very hectic month for me and I didn't think of her as anyone more than a band member. 

Then in the summer I met another girl, who left a bad taste in my mouth of what to expect from someone who you'd consider your ""significant other."" Let's just say, she was the wrong blonde.

Now, the love is back (for first girl). After a couple weeks of thought I decided to stop waiting around and do something about it. Yesterday I approached her and talked for a bit. I made it off with her Snapchat and texted her a bunch last night. We'll see what happens next, but things are looking real good.

291,Am I allowed to love,"Prior to two years ago I avoided all romantic relationships. I didn’t think it was fair to other people knowing I was basically leading them on. Two years ago I thought I was in the clear and so I got into a relationship. I ended up breaking her heart when my cancer returned. I ended our relationship because I started imagining how badly I’d hurt her when I die. I’ve had cancer since I was a kid and it was the furthest amount of time that had passed without me having cancer, 7 years. I’m in my mid 20s. I’ve felt like the shittiest person since I let her go. I loved her. I knew all along chances were the cancer would return and I still put her through all of it, I loved her and I still did that to her. 

Realistically speaking, I won’t make it to 30. I’ve never tried to withhold my situation and I’m honest about it from the get go, but it feels like I’m forcing emotional trauma on those I interact with. I feel terrible for forcing it on my friends and family. I try to not interact with too many new people as I know I’ll inevitably end up hurting them, when it’s romantic it’s even worse.

Me and her hit it off nicely she came back to mine and we did the deed but we spoke for hours about each other’s life etc... we really bonded. I told her to come over again the following night and to pack some clothes to come with me for the next part of my holiday for two days. I told her I’d pay for her food etc... just would like companionship. She couldn’t decide what to do I kept trying to convince her saying it’s two days away from her unhealthy going to a bar having drinks and looking for client to take her home. She had told me she hated doing that, me being me I just wanted to show the girl something nice and just give her a break. She called and she told me over the phone she didn’t know what to do I said just come otherwise you will always think what if, she said she will see me later and call me later. She was still in two minds. By this point I had realised I do like her my friends took the piss out of me saying she’s a prostitute she’s just going to fuck you over or whatever. She told me she would come over the night before to see me potentially for last time. I told her come with a open mind. She never did come she messaged me one of her other friends had a problem with a guy. All my friends had gone out and hit the main town and said to me come she’s not going to come she’s a prostitute. But I saw the good in her and I genuinely believed she did like to me ( I was always very polite and nice to her never treated her like a piece of meat) She never did turn up I waited all night for her hoping she would come with a packed bag and take a leap of faith with me. But it never happened it’s almost morning I haven’t slept I’m leaving at 12 I sent her a message saying that I don’t think she’s coming tonight or coming for the extra two days and that it was a shame it could have been fun but we will never know. She never responded to that. I believe she went out with her friends to the usual spot to find clients and have a drink while I waited in my hotel room for her thinking hope she comes wanted to show her a taste of a better life. Just would like some advice on this I’m quite upset about it I actually believed she was different we had such an extensive and deep conversation about life. She told her friends about how nice I am etc...when the others boys wake up I’m going to be no doubt laughing stock of the group. I was wondering if I should send her another message.

301,Power of pain,"My Gf (19) and I (22) had been in a relationship for about 5 months, but knew each other our entire lives. She and I both had fallen victim to societal pressure and changed who we were to the point of social anxiety, insecurity, and irrational thoughts/behaviors. 

While I was in college, I realized this isn’t who I was deep down and began finding myself through philosophy and other thought related studies on my own. Doing so has given me a deep beautiful understanding of life that has provided me nothing but happiness every day for the past 3 years since finding myself.  The thing that made me come to self realization and take action was being suspended from school for drinking during my sophomore year. This was the lowest I had ever been in life and gave me the opportunity to realize that I was the main thing standing in the way of living an authentic life. 

She however, wasn’t exposed to any true hardships or fell victim to realizing her own faults in her problems. It caused pain in our relationship and a lot of turbulence. I tried to break up with her a couple of times because of the pain it was bringing me internally, but each time remembered that all I wanted was to give her an opportunity to see life in such a beautiful way and to truly be happy. 

I  was the most important thing to her but she was unintentionally pushing me away with her immaturities (like starting arguments over nothing or trying to control my decisions). After I had the taken the last bit of negativity that I could handle, I had a thought that maybe I can give her a chance to find this happiness, with or without me, by breaking up with her. I broke up with her and sure enough, she was devastated. She said she had realized all the things she was doing wrong and was so sorry with how she treated me and took advantage of my love. 

She had hit the low of lows for her. After a couple of days I explained to her that I still wanted more than anything to be her friend and support her through this since she doesn’t really have anyone else (at least that would be a good impact on her enlightenment). Since then, she and I get coffee and discuss our thoughts and the way she’s looking st life and it’s beautiful.  She is realizing all of the things I tried to explain to her during our relationship, she’s dealing with stress so well, she isn’t sad all the time, and our love for each other is stronger than ever.

I can’t help but feel bad for having to break up with her, as this typically goes against the idea of unconditional love, but my intentions have played to be extremely pure and effective. She’s writing letters to me, exploring her head, and reflecting on her life. Still, I question if it’s my position to be doing this... 

I’m not sure if I’ll ever find that answer, but what has come from it is truly amazing. She appreciates what I’ve done and how I treat her more than ever, and has even agreed that me breaking up with her was the best thing to ever happen to her.

The fact that you aren’t holding their hand, shyly making eye contact, and leaning in for a kiss literally hurts. 

Every once in a while you have a moment when you’re not thinking of them, but the your brain tricks you. That wonderfully perfect smell they have seemingly enters your nose for a brief moment and you start thinking of them again. You close your eye and you can see that smile that makes you melt. 

You can’t eat because food does not satisfy you the way a kiss from that special someone does. It’s not like you’re hungry anyway, there’s a pit in your stomach reminding you how empty you feel without them. 

You’d do anything to see them right now. To hell with other commitments and responsibilities, the only thing that should matter is that you’re with them. 

I realize none of this is new to most people. It’s just something I’ve been experiencing recently for the first time in a long time. I know it’s not yet true love, but I want so desperately for it to become that. Until then it is just an overwhelming cocktail of bliss and agony.

Her: Everything is all good, I promise :)

Me: Its not IMO, I REALLY fucked up, what i did was harassment and border line stalking, and its scary to see you or your mom(who works at my school) cause i dont want to get in trouble

her: You're not gonna get into trouble

Me: Im sorry for spilling my guts, but thats my stupid two cents on this situation

her: Its all okay

me: if my dumbass ever did that again, one of your friends will probably try and hurt me or worse, i'll get sent to jail for stalking

Her: You won't do it again

Me: no

Her: You're a good person, i know you wouldn't do it again

Me: I wouldn't, but i'll find some dumbass way to do it again and get my ass beat by judah or ethan, or worse, get killed by one of them

Her: They wouldn't hurt or kill you

Me: sure, i've heard from dominic that ur BF isn't a MF to mess with, so i'd get my shit kicked in by him, thats why i live in fear either talking to you or being near your mom, or around your old classmates or BF

Her: My boyfriend isn't judah or ethan

Her: I actually broke up with my boyfriend last week

Me: ooh that sucks

Me: but like, im hesitant to talk to you, cause i think i fuck up, ill either be found in a ditch dead, or stangled to death by someone

Her: If you do its again, I'll just block you for good. They won't do anything 

Me: idk man, its not like i'll do it again, but the thought of your classmates fucking terrifies me

Her: I've told you multiple time now that they won't do anything 

Me: I KNOW that captain obvious, but im talking about the future with other girls

Her: well than dont do that shit to her girls and you won't have that problem

Me: I know that

Me: I dont never want to feel like i did that day, i wanted to go to the place i loved (RHCP reference)

Her: The main point is: when someone says stop, stop

Me: I know

her: good

318,Why is it so hard to move on?,"So my ex boyfriend (of about 2 months) broke up with me back in early September. His reasoning was that he was struggling with depression, he had withdrawn from us and within that time of withdrawal he had fallen out of love with me. Obviously we hadn’t been together long and honestly I saw the possibility of it coming due to the decline in his personality over a few weeks leading up to the break up, but this really hit me hard. After having been with someone so abusive, this guy was a breath of fresh air. He‘s so kind and loving, caring, passionate, and honestly everything I had ever wanted in a guy. My type all around. As someone who struggles with attachment, abandonment, and depression this was a lot. My depression got significantly worse, he basically ghosted me for a month and didn’t talk to me until I called him in a depressed crisis. He eventually told me that he just can’t be friends with me and needed to cut me off entirely and I havent heard from him since end of October. I go back and forth loving and hating him. I know deep down I will most likely always love him for the amazing time we spent, but I cannot help but be a bit angry that he left me and said he didn’t wanna care or worry about anybody when I needed him most, even just as a friend. I truly felt like I had found my person and again I realize we were together for such a short time, but we both pictured being together much longer. Is this stupid of me? Stupid of me to still love him and wonder if there is a chance for us in the future once we both spend time healing? Has anyone else ever experienced being told your love was invalid because your relationship was so short?

324,The love I feel for you,"It's really difficult to figure out where to start writing...   
A, you and I have shared so much in such a short time. At least that's how I feel... When we are together I can feel that we are so connected and attracted to each other. I still remember how hard I fell for you in high school, I longed for you so badly. You didn't seem sure whether or not you liked me back, but there was still an attraction there and we were very physical together... After some time though, you said we should make it official and we started dating... It was a really nice time in my life and I wish we would have gotten more than just a year together... I feel like our relationship could be better now after some personal growth and maturity from both of us.  
But you don't want to be with me like that anymore... Not romantically. You've said you wouldn't mind, but that doesn't mean you want to. Plus you said once you wanted to find ""something better""... I'm sure you didn't mean anything bad with that message, but you can sometimes forget the power of your words. I was so sure that I didn't want to be with you either, but the feelings are coming back to me. Ever since we reconnected last month, I have been thinking about you almost every day... Some days the longing hits harder than others... And since we're still friends (such close friends), I get to talk to you every day too... And when you're busy, I feel a bit lonely. At the moment there's no one that can fill me with happiness like you... And you don't have to do much to make me happy. I love you as a person, not the acts that you do or don't do.  
But I digress...Things happen for a reason and I think that breaking up, in the end, was the right thing to do... Plus we're not living in the same city anymore so it'd be tough. I think I just need to let these feelings off my chest and see if it helps me move on. I feel as expressing my feelings is very cathartic and I can almost feel a relief wash over me as I write all of this... 

&amp;#x200B;

If things align for us to end up together in the future, I'd be happy... And if not, I know there are other people out there who I can also connect with. But you are my first true connection, and I will never forget the love I feel for you right now. I just hope I can be patient. Because I want to be in love, it's a very nice feeling, but it's not something you rush into or you look for and find right away. Love will find me. I just need to love myself first and foremost.",love,1542903640,Mdelarose,1,1,True,2018-11-22

332,The 5 Biggest Relationship Issues for Men," **#1 - Attraction** 

 This is always a hot-button issue after we’ve been in a relationship for awhile. Honestly, we get bored sometimes. Some women even say men have a low attention span. I think this is very true for our attraction level.  

&amp;#x200B;

**#2 - Sex**

The more the better! Seriously though, initially there is a lot of excitement and newness about being with someone, but then usually it morphs into something boring and regular. Oh, it’s Friday night — must be date night. 

&amp;#x200B;

**#3 - Communication**

Sometimes it seems like it is impossible to communicate openly and honestly without getting our heads bitten off. We feel like we can’t always say what we want to say without starting a fight. 

&amp;#x200B;

**#4 - Honesty**

This is another issue that goes both ways. We have a hard time being completely honest about things sometimes, and this goes for our feelings and our life goals. 

&amp;#x200B;

**#5 - Insecurity**

We are insecure a lot of the time. Even a confident guy can have issues. We worry that women will go away. That is why when you seem happy and content, we focus on other aspects of our lives, but when you seem unhappy, we give you much more focus.

I needed to stop chasing after you. I needed to stop tiring myself out and forget about the plans we made(they were real to me).  I needed to save face and just salvage whatever was left of my dignity. Did I ever stop loving you ?  No. I merely let go of the fantasy of you and me ever being together.

We added each other on Snapchat and started talking. We agreed to meet at your apartment. 

I arrived except I didn’t know how to parallel park and you laughed as I messaged you that. You came out of your apartment to find me since I was nearby so I waited at my car. 

We finally met and you looked super cute. You were very big, but had clear skin and a smile that reminded me of a chipmunk. 

It was kinda funny how you looked at my face and then stared at my chest and then looking back at my face. We talked for a bit as we walked to your place. We both had the same political point of view as we discovered. 

Your apartment had a lot of people over and there were at least 10 people in the apartment. I was nervous and did lots of stupid things, but you never insulted me. I waved at your roommates as they were pretty sweet too. 

You sat down and fell off the chair. I was trying to hard not to laugh so I turned around. 

We practiced and I fumbled around a lot. The lesson ended and you let me use your bass case. 

I messaged you after that saying how cool you were and how awkward I was. You said thanks and we spoke for a bit. I said how I was glad to meet you and you never responded after that for that night, but you were pretty sweet. 

I messaged you again for some more stuff and you responded. 

I have no idea why I am in love with you or if this is infatuation, but you stared at me a lot and you were sweet to me in many ways.

342,Apeee you are missed.....,"I have no clue why I met this person….it's said that a moment of love sometimes lasts for a lifetime….I had come out of an abusive relationship and after about seven months I met this guy and I never knew he would mean so much to me….we started started talking over watsapp from October 2017....It was 31st December he called me for the first time….He did flirt with me and I never knew he'd become so much important to me in the months that followed. It was a windy winter day in the month of January when I first met him…I donot know what was about him that made me connect with him instantly.....…I knew I didn't love him yet….we again met a couple of times and I gradually could feel I'm getting addicted to this person…we met around three times and he then moved to Mumbai for his internship which is a part of MBA curriculum… and I got my internship in Bangalore itself….We were in the same city but not in the same college …He was in IIM B and I was doing my MBA from NMIMS……so we kept talking for around eight months and realised I was madly in love with this person ….I also knew he might not understand the depth of my emotions but I couldn't just stop expressing what I felt for him…It was in the month of May I remember being misdiagnosed with acute lukemia....I had been facing some health issues for the past few months …I kept on talking to him and thought of not letting him know as it would trouble him  ,he was alone in Mumbai….I decided I'd tell him once he returns….. Meanwhile I was going through a lot of medicine  procedures and somehow I felt he is always there for me and I was so glad he made me feel what love is, he was the only good thing in my life amidst all the trauma...….My parents even told me to quit MBA because of health issues but I knew if I would give up ….he acted as a force which kept m and I had to complete my MBA at any cost…..Last month I was crying a lot and wrote this message for him:

There's something I had been holding on..I thought I'll tell you after we meet again…..u remember the first time I met you I told you I'm not well and I was supposed to meet a doctor the next day ...I don't know if u remember....I was suffering from tremendous pain then and doctors kept saying lack of vitamins etc....In May when u were interning in Mumbai ,I was actually in a lot of pain........I was misdiagnosed with AML...and u know everything was going wrong I didn't know what was happening .... everything was falling apart...I could see my dad crying infront of me when doctors said that.....u won't believe u gave me a force which helped me to keep moving.....the day u texted me n asked if we'll go out to watch Avengers after you come back I was admitted in hospital......I just told you to come back.....there was a time I was undergoing very painful tests and I used to keep praying that I'll come out of all this and hug you and cry my heart out and not let u go....I was in a section of the hospital where I could see ppl who would die within a few days.....u used to joke  ki we'll have three kids one son n two daughters...that day I remember before my bone marrow biopsy all I was thinking everything will be fine and I'll meet u soon and I'll pull your leg more.....I definitely knew I had gained a friend who would not give  up on me...Anyways it was an infection and I was completely fine before the new session began with some antibiotics....I know I've always behaved like a retard....I cannot exactly explain what I exactly felt in the months that followed ...maybe physically I had recovered but mentally I didn't.....I didn't feel like waking up....sleep was my only escape.....I used to break down in between classes ......I didn't feel like talking to my friends even... and I know that time I used to text u like crazy ...it did annoy you...... it was selfish on my part that I didn't want to let you go....All I know had u not been there I wouldn't have overcome that phase....Those hospital rooms still haunt me sometimes.....I was battling so much.....once u r told u have a disease which is going to kill you.....u're almost dead  that very moment .....Anyways if I complete my mba it'll be because of you....You've been my angel and you know I was actually quitting MBA,my parents even insisted me to quit then seeing me in pain and I thought of taking up a job in a stratup later.......Thank you so much for coming in my life...and I'm really sorry for annoying you so much it must have been mentally toxic for you........I always believe you are the best gift I got from Bangalore and there's no equivalent material gift I can ever give you.... 

PS:It was my birthday and I asked him to commit to me if he loves me….I knew I was in love with him and he used to tell the same  but that day he told he lacks the conviction of doing justice to our relationship as he is busy with his MBA…we never met after that and probably we never will…..I would never force him to be in my life but I wish he called me atleast one last time …just talked to me one last time….maybe I used to text him a lot even after he broke up ....... I told him at times to block me because I could never control my urge to talk to him and he did block me this month, he probably became my world  because of the situations he came in my life….I know I might never get a person like him but I wish I could sit beside him and tell him what he meant to me one last time…..He once told me he had fallen out of love but I don’t really understand how that happens…..You never know when you are meeting a person for the last time…..All I know he was a great guy and I'd be so happy to be with him….He is presently in Lyon for his exchange….And I pray god that he gets everything he wants in life….and I'll always love him….Apeeeee if you ever read this….I want you to know you are very adorable to me and I really wish I could hug you one last time …I always will have so much respect for you….

It was the starting of summertime so I’d stay in my room all day , AC on full blast, just talking to you. I’d sleep on call with you. I was always so touched by the fact that no matter how long I slept whenever I’d wake you’d still be there. You’d laugh about the sounds id make in my sleep. I remember a week before I went on vacation. We were so sad but we both made many promises. And the day I was leaving. A few minutes before I left for the airport we were still talking on the phone.

356,My ex checked in on me last night after ignoring each other for 1 year,"Well i’ll explain everything briefly
So around this time in November..well specifically November 22nd me and my ex had our first argument, like a serious one. He got frustrated over something and u know this drama. Trust me, its really really silly. So after that, he completely stopped texting me for 3 weeks and i’ve been waiting for him to text me but he didn’t. So i got even more mad and removed him from all my social media and he literally couldn’t reach me at all, stupid right? I didnt even give him a chance to apologize lol.

So basically after one year, which was last night, Somehow he managed to get my best friend’s number and asked her to give him my social media accounts (he got mad when she refused). Of course she had to ask me first so she did and i told her to give him my Instagram account and she did. He texted me and asked how iam doing and how’s life with me (ikr so casual and random) and i told him iam fine and stuff and then he told me he just remembered me and wanted to check in on me and  i thanked him (in which i doubt, i dont just remember someone and check in on them) 

So he seemed to be online and go offline when i go offline. Anyways, I just really really want to know if he still has feelings for me because i still have feelings for him. Even after one year of our break up i still think of him daily. I really want to know if its mutual. PLUS how do i know if he’s in a relationship or not?

P.S. he sounded like he had more things to say. The bad thing is that we’re both extremely stubborn and obstinate (kinda the reason we broke up)

I just want him to be happy, no matter what, and he feels the same. We're best friends who are destined to be with each other. When I see him, I feel butterflies in my stomach and feel light on my skin because just his presence makes me smile and laugh and feel every good feeling. All I ask is to be lucky enough to give him the same feeling. Everything is perfect, except for one minor detail.

He lives in Ohio, and I live in Virginia. And the timing is wrong, and the place is wrong.

So we can't be together. And it hurts. It hurts so much that I feel like I'm going to throw up and sneeze at the same time but it's neither is happening so I'm stuck in this torturous purgatory of ""if only""s.

And it hurts so much. But if it didn't, it wouldn't really be worth it, would it?

I had always dreamed that one day it was possible that I would run into the “one”, you know the couples you see that grow old and look ridiculously adorable together? Those ones that look like they are just as in love as they were when they very first met? Yeah, that one! 

I actually met him here, right here on Reddit! My life has been completely changed in an instant from a simple post on [r/r4r](https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/). I was looking for someone to just interact with, someone to make a solid real connection with, someone who could relate to me, and someone who understood what it was like to grow up in my era. I was tired of dating apps, and I was tired of attracting the same people constantly. I was tired of heartbreak and tired of the same old bs. I received so many responses and barely replied to any of them, so many were similar and they all just kind of came off very generic until later that evening. 

He came in so simply but so nerdy and yet spoke to me like he had known me for years with one line that made me giggle. “Be kind, rewind”. Something from my childhood that instantly took me back for a moment and seemed instantly nostalgic. He had a way with words that felt familiar yet intriguing. I had to respond. Several messages in, we both answered almost instantly with just simply our phone numbers. It was crazy how in sync we were with one another. Upon texting, we discovered that we’re merely born hours apart, and share multiple things in common. To this day, we find so many similarities in one another as well as what sets us apart, and now we’re continuing to become even closer by the day. 

I’ve found my person and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for us. I can’t believe that Reddit helped me find the perfect man for me! We’re beginning to plan a future together and deciding where to go from here. Thank you Reddit for giving me hope for an incredible future with an amazing man who shows me daily why everyone else failed, why I had to endure the heartache, and why these communities are so amazing. I have nothing but greatness ahead of me. ",love,1543143350,jennawhat,13,1,True,2018-11-25

My mom really likes you. You come over for dinner often. This place is beautiful. The neighborhood is cast in a bluish green fog at night, making the light sources contrast against the darkness with their yellow glow. We take walks together at night. You like me for more than my body and you kiss my forehead often.

We're going to prom together. It's silly and we both think it's a weird tradition but we go anyways. Our attendance documented in pictures, you next to me, taller, your hand on my waist. You're still a boy and there's no bitterness here. There's not much more to say but I don't want this to end so I'll keep writing, providing detail.

I don't know if I'm alone or with others but it doesn't matter because I feel as comfortable alone as I do with company. Everything is light and bright and easy here. Hard to believe such a place exists for me. I'm a good person there. People respect me.

I listen to songs and I long to see your face, I long to feel your presence and hear your laugh, I strongly desire to be able to pick you up when you’re down and hold your head up when all you want to do is stare at the ground.

381,Missing you so much when we're apart,"TL;DR Just really missing him, but he's on a plane right now, so I thought I'd share here. Anyone else feel this way when their SO is away?

When my job sent me on a week long business trip as usual, I said goodbye and flew away. One week became two weeks, so I decided to fly you over to join me for a weekend getaway, so we didn't have to be away from each other for so long. 

I can't believe Friday Saturday Sunday went by so quickly. It feels like half an hour ago when we saw each other here. Like you said to me when we were on the way to the airport to send you back home, it felt like only a quarter of a day had gone by. Time always flies when I'm with you. You make me laugh and keep me happy unlike anyone else ever has. 

To some extent, I think it was a bad decision to bring you here. My boss just told me I may have to be here for another 2 weeks, if not 3. In the same room where we were, eating at the same places we ate, taking the same shuttle busses we took, walking the same paths we walked. 

After you left, I went to get dinner alone tonight, and when I got on the shuttle back to the hotel, the driver looked around the station and asked me in disbelief ""only one person?"" cause we'd always gone together for the past 3 days. That's when it hit me, I have all these memories of you and me associated with all these places I'm going to be, but you're not here with me anymore. Just last night, you were lying on this bed next to me tucking me in, but now I'm alone. And it feels so sad. I feel so sad. 

I know you'll miss me a lot too, so I don't want to remind you too much of how sad we both are to be apart from each other. I just really wished my job could be less demading so we could spend more time together than apart. ",love,1543155556,WorriedKid345,1,1,True,2018-11-25

389,The machinations of the romantic heart,"I find it interesting that emotions and actions can be manipulated with the slightest touch.    Word choice, tone, timing and manipulation of intent and facts can shape our hearts forever.    The variables may change,  but our hearts don’t forget how they feel when either in euphoric bliss or agony.     To exacerbate matters, humans crave the dopamine rush from when those moments occur.     We as humans feel most alive when we are in the throes of passion either in euphoric bliss or utter despair.    It’s the melancholy that we abhor.   We rationalize actions for favorable outcomes,  but the definition of favorable becomes blurry.    We rely on popular axioms to safely determine pragmatic solutions to given variables.     However what happens when chaos becomes the desired outcome?  Chaos being equally distant from apathy as euphoric love.    

The romantic heart, I believe, seeks these two polar opposites out.     If not one, the other, until the scorched earth has no trace of what was once beautiful.     Invariably this ends in tragedy more likely than success.    It is for this reason most of us stick to the practical.   We say “ I love you,but...”.    Practicality requires conditions in the real world to exist in order for it to thrive.

I believe there are those choice few that have tasted the bliss and despair and hunger for it and refuse to settle on such pragmatic pursuits.    It is to these doomed souls that I tip my hat and congratulate them on successfully isolating themselves from the human condition.    I admire you and I’m terrified for you and of you.

398,I'M TRULY BLESSED,"I've had my fair share of break-ups and heartbreaks and I promised myself to not fall in love again. Oh, what a joke.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm the guy that believes in fate and that there is someone walking around that is your predestined soulmate. After my last experiences I lost hope, but here is when the story starts.

&amp;#x200B;

I was attracted to a girl from my school and we followed each other on Social Media, but we had never talked or anything, we just knew eachothers first names. 

Every picture/story that she would post, I'd crush a little bit harder. But I was too shy to approach her or even 'slide in her DM's'. Mainly because she had a boyfriend and I didn't want to get rejected or even interrupt a relationship.

Then, when I was on vacation with my parents, a few thousand Kilometres away from home. (I was in Crete, in a town where I have been going since I was 8 months old.)

I noticed that she recently posted a picture in THE SAME town that I had been staying in. What are the odds in that, I thought. So I had to shoot my shot. I sent her a DM asking if she would mind going to grab drinks for an evening, just to chat and have a friend on this vacation (I thought she still had a boyfriend). She wasnt really up for it at first, but she made up her mind and we grabbed some drinks after all.

We hit it off instantly, we had deep conversations and we really got to know eachother, there was a serious connection. Then she told me off her break-up and that she wanted a guy that was mature and intelligent (it was me). We weren't really flirty at first, but we both felt more attraction than 'just friends'. 

&amp;#x200B;

The day after, we grabbed drinks again and we talked for hours straight, I was sad because I had to go home and a little afraid because I thought it would end then. I wasnt really sure if our 'friendship' would hold up in our home country.

&amp;#x200B;

But it did, she texted me first, we went on a few dates and kissed. Her family loves me and so does mine. I actually feel like all the pieces are coming together and I have really found my soulmate. There is literally nothing in my mind that tells me that she isn't the one.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you all can experience the same joy as I have!!

410,This is partnership - finding love as a single mom.. never expected to find something like this.,"I (30f) have been dating a friend of mine (31m) for about 6 months; where only 2 months of that have not been LD.  I have come out of a 10 year relationship (my only relationship experience), and this week my heart swelled to feel what it's like to feel love.

My boyfriend lives about an hour from where we live. He came to visit me and the kids and say through Thanksgiving break.  One of the days after the holidays, I was overwhelmed by a situation with the kids and felt myself beginning to lose my patience.. he pulled me into his arms, and slowly rocked me as his voice came clear and projected, yet calm and precise as he said everything I was wishing to say.. but in a way I was too overwhelmed to handle by myself.  It hit me suddenly - ""this is partnership..""

&amp;#x200B;

This is what it's like to be with someone who TRULY puts effort and energy into the relationship... this is what it feels like to be able to trust and rely on another human being... this is what it is to get what you give...

&amp;#x200B;

This is what it's like to be loved and valued.

&amp;#x200B;

I sobbed silently to myself while he completely defused this situation as I stood with my face buried in his chest.  When he got the kids squared away (just using his calm words), he looked at me and asked if I was okay, and I couldn't find the wit to explain that I was over here just falling deeper into love with him.  It's intense sometimes and I don't know what to do with my emotions.

This is the stuff that I was missing, that I thought did not exist.  I thought for sure that I would never find someone who actually WANTED to be my partner.  I always had shame and guilt invested in the idea of dating - figured being a single mom meant having to always apologize to people for having them as a secondary priority.  Not with him... he actually invests in my kids... in my future.. in my peace of mind.  He really means it.. I can feel it, and it's only scary because I feel like this is the stuff that shouldn't come so easily... right?

**This is the story:**

* Met this girl on vacation when I was 22 and fell in love for the first time. 
* She told me she loves me back but after a couple of months she broke up with me because ""I'm not tall enough + not rich enough""  
* Her family was also not ok with it for the same reasons. 
* I'm sure the long distance played a role too

**This experience tear me apart, I lost confidence, felt really terrible. It changed me.**

* I became obsessed with my height (even more) and also money and wanted to become rich to prove them wrong. 
* Did not trust any girls afterward
* Always felt like I'm not worthy to be love
* never could stop thinking about her.
* My every achievement made me think about her again

&amp;#x200B;

After years I saw her again. She wanted to talk and was playful (we were playing cards and she was trying to be funny) but I ignored her and was kind of a dick.  Last time I saw her she gave me a sad look. It was like, she was sad that I was leaving without really talking to her. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My Current situation:**

* I'm 31 years old now
* All my life I lived in poverty, however things are changing now
* I own my own apartment
* Got a good degree with a promising job and a startup on the rise
* I was never able to forget about this girl and compared her to every girl I met and got close to. 

&amp;#x200B;

**1 or 2 months ago I added her on Instagram.**

*  I tried to open the conversation but couldn't really do it. (asked stupid questions and she replied coldly)
* I was and am just too scared to make a fool out of myself AGAIN.
* For me she is this huge event in my life. What if I'm just a random dude to her?
* She never posts anything on IG. She would only do that if I posted something on my own IG. 
* It felt weird. It felt like we were trying to get each other's attention without really communicating.
* Her posts were always somehow related to my posts (or maybe I'm making this up in my head)

&amp;#x200B;

**RIGHT NOW:**

* She just blocked me on IG. 
* I feel like it's because I was too much of a pussy to actually talk to her.

* Should I tell her about how  I feel? Regardless of a possible embarrassment?

If you don’t have sex for a long time, your immune system becomes significantly weaker. Germs then have an easier job of spreading in your body and you can catch a cold or get the flu more easily. So, just by having more sex, you can help keep your herbal remedy teas in the closet!

### 2. Your stress levels increase

430,I GAVE UP ON LOVE,"Just like that she was gone. As I hopped into my car to drive away the rivers were already flowing down my face. This was going to be hard, it was a fool’s decision to do what I had just done. Put on a brave face and let go of something because it was right. How do you recover from it? I won’t.
 
The unfortunate thing was in the next coming months I would be pushed to the very limits of the string of life, fighting the urge to just saying fuck it all and leaving. Running away from my feelings and thoughts. You see it in the movies and TV two people split up and they throw themselves into their work, hobbies, social lives and what not but not me.
 
With my line of work, I didn’t get the chance to grieve my own stupidity, I went from working 2-3hrs a week to working 10-12hrs a day. But the time has come for me to grieve and I’m going to write about it, why? Because if I don’t I might go crazy also because maybe out there in the world someone else is going through this all as well. You’re not alone so hear my ups and downs and maybe share yours too?
 
Now I don’t want to go into great detail about what happened between myself and her and I won’t be using names as I still wish to remain anonymous and wish to respect her privacy as well. After dating for a year and a half I decided that in order for her to pursue her dream job that it would be better for us to split up. I didn’t want her to feel like she was dragging me around and that my future was to be put on hold so she can blossom. The whole if you love them you know when to let them go thing right. That’s what I told myself.
 
Fast forward to now the dates Wednesday 28th November 2018 its 12:41am, she and I broke up back in August but I was so busy with working that I didn’t get a second to realise how truly hurt I am about it all. Don’t get me wrong I was incredibly sad at the time I cried a lot but it was different. In my head it was still the right thing to do but somethings have changed. For the past month my thoughts have be flooded with the feelings of falling again. It has caused me to realise that I was wrong.
 
Today is the first day really where I’ve had the free time to dwell and feel sad and it didn’t hit me until last night around 11pm now because we ended on reasonable terms we still talk and hang out and that’s okay. In a weird way its helping. You’ll never really understand that so don’t bother abusing me about it.
 
As we said goodnight, I rolled over and put my phone down and it was just a big vomit ball of feelings pounding my heart, I freaked out and got straight back onto the phone to spill my heart to her in hope that she’d take me back. Which she didn’t. That’s that.
 
Tonights the night it became clear that breaking up with her wasn’t the right thing to do. But its whats happened and I need to make myself happy again somehow. Later this morning im going to wake up and feel exhausted and dead on the inside from the lack of good sleep. Its fine because I barely sleep anyways. I think its my bodys way of saying fucken grieve you idiot. In the past I’ve been pretty good with relationship advice and just helping people begin to get their lives together (move on from a girl) but this whole feelings thing has really stumped me. My mind is clouded and my heart is… well its having a heart attack of emotions. What a shit joke fml I’m turning into my dad. I have a lot of feeling of anxiety and a lack of self worth, I think its normal to feel that way… I mean I wouldn’t quote me on this and if you do feel this was maybe speak to a proffesional about this but don’t we all constantly worry about shit and look at others and think why are they better than me. Just today I was out there insulting my snoz (nose). As for the feeling sad, bloody oath I should feel sad about this I mean this woman is amazing, she is wife material she really is, I’d be angry as all hell if I walked away from this relationship smiling and happy. IM ALLOWED TO BED SAD I GAVE UP ON LOVE AND THAT’S SAD. Maybe you can relate to that?
 
I think I will conclude it there for the night. I’m not sure how often I will post this sorta stuff but I will definitely try to get on here to keep anyone whos reading this updated with whats happening. Even if noone reads this at least I’ll be able to relive the progress or downfall of my life.

431,What is love?,"What is love?
Compromise can't be love. But you can say, sacrifice is the another form of love. If you are in love, only by giving, giving &amp; giving you will be satisfied, you will be fulfilled. There is nothing to lose in love.
You can listen it in your heartbeat, you can feel it in your vein, you can see it in your subconscious mind and you can enjoy its company in the darkest moment of your aloneness. Love doesn't come to destroy your life, it comes to make you the strongest &amp; the purest. It doesn't leave you, it lives in you. It doesn't hurt you, it heals you. It sharpen your feelings of enjoyment. It refresh you, it recharge you. In love, you will discover vivid pattern of yourself. Once its enter in your life, it will last forever. And, yes, that's the thing l say love...!!!",love,1543334076,sharmin_laila,0,1,True,2018-11-27
432,💛💙 Always the one 💛💙,"There are days when I wonder if you were just a dream. 
Days when I ask myself ""Was she real, or fantasy""?

It's very hard, extremely so, because if you were real?  Why did I let you go?  

I try to tell myself it was never my call, that no matter how I felt, you were never mine at all.  

But if that's true, and we'll assume it is, you would say to yourself ""I was never his"".  

Let us write this off as a sad example of unrequited love, I'll ask for help, maybe from the man above.  

But I've asked already so many times, wrote so many unread lines, 

why did I meet you that cold dark night, why did you make you eyes shine bright?  

Why did you smile and lead me on?, knowing deep down you wanted me gone.  

Why did you hold me, make sweet sweet love, if your feelings deep down you planned to shove? 

 Why did you kiss me so softly all over? And act like you were my long lost lover?  

Why would you do this?  How could you bear, to crush my soul and my heart you tear?  

Was it all a game to you?  Did you know from the start that is was already through? 

My mind still filled with thoughts of you, the main theme being ""what has this sweet girl been through""?  

The only way she could do this to me, is if she wanted me to see, that pain is real, it terrifies, looking back I saw it in her eyes.  

That look of joy mixed with fear, you must have wondered ""will he always hold me near""?  

A question only time could prove, but you didn't wait, you had to move.  

Leaving me, no chance to explain, you left, you drove, back to the city of rain.  

My chance is past, my dreams are shattered, I tell myself ""at one point you mattered"".  

 After all of this I hold no grudge, I don't know your life, and refuse to judge.  

I just wanted you to know, no matter what I loved you so.  

Your smile, your eyes, your soft sweet touch, your kiss, your love was never too much.  

To this day you haunt my dreams, where you smile is still warm, and your eyes still beam.  

Why our paths crossed I'll never know, but I'm so happy they did my heart tells me so.  

And while it hurts so extremely bad, I cannot keep what I never had.  

Perhaps someday, some other time, I can be yours, and you can be mine.  

Until that day, should it never come, please know to me, you sweet girl, were always 
""the one"".

433,About that girl...,"You know.. 2 years from now I ... I met this girl.. online, and before you start arguing that - online is the worst place to meet people, listen.
So.. we were texting .. we have exchanged few pics, of course at the beginning nothing serious but after few months conversations started to get deeper..
Throught these 2 years I had tough times.. I was in depression and all that s**t.. And everytime I have texted her, all of bad thoughts just disapeared, just vanished..
It became like a drug to me..
So then you asked why I haven't met up with her? There was no chance for me.. she is quite far away.. and back then I had no possibilities to reach her..
At that moment I kinda realised that she... is just different.. that she is.. AND till then every girl that I am hooking up with is like her .. everything - her character, how she looks, all my girls are similiar to her.
She started hating me, I just texted her .. every f***ing night.. for about 6 months..
After about a year I realised I'm in love with her.. after that I left, I blocked her, blocked every way that I could reach her.. and still .. I somehow managed to ..
To be honest with you.. now she hates me real bad, at least that's what I think.. I text her a few times a month .. and everytime she reads my message I get those goosebumps..
And now, when I can meet her... she doesn't
I think I'm stuck forever with the girl who will never be mine... Yup :))

But I want to confess how much I will ever keep you in my heart.

We met each other and I was afraid at first. But u convinced me that u had good intentions and I trusted you. 
And I am glad I did.
Because of you I learned to have other points of views. Thank you.
You enriched my life so much, you made it more exited. Thank you.
The first time I said I love you to you, you were so happy  that I wished I would have told you earlier just to see you that happy. 

I had so many first times with you and every one was intense and worth it.
You tried to make me happy with little things u tried to remember.

But more importantly, I never felt so truly loved by someone for being me than by you.
You accepted me.
Accepted my circumstances.
Accepted my difficult personality.

Never ever let someone go out of your life, who is like that.

I learned so much because of you.

I am so sorry for our break up. 
That I could not make you happy enough.

The pain I feel is so bad I am currently not functioning for a single damn thing in my life.
Everything was better with you.
I really believed that we had a future, and I secretly still do.
That we would have children and be a happily married couple.
I saw you in my life for always.
And I do not want to imagine other wise.


There is always someone better, but I beg you to choose me again.

I will love you forever and you will always be in my heart.

440,Caught Feelings - Long Read,"I met this young woman around 6 months ago. She is a resident at the property that I am a property manager at - bad idea, I know. We didn't talk much at first, except for random professional interactions. But, she always seemed to look at me for just a little too long, and I was struck by how kind and sweet she was. Every time we interacted it would just just slightly more interesting. Inch by inch, we slowly, other the course of months, got closer and closer. My coworker and I stopped at the restaurant she works at for a beer one Wednesday afternoon, and he told me that she absolutely lit up when she noticed me walking in. She even called me at the office the next day to see how bad my headache was. A couple weeks later, she added me on Facebook. Then, a week later she gave me her cell number. She was into me, and made no effort to hide it. I didn't either.

&amp;#x200B;

It was 1 AM, and she came over. She just wanted to see me for a few minutes. She kissed me, and her lips were the sweetest that I have ever tasted. Then, she told me about her boyfriend. I had a sneaking suspicion that she belonged to someone else, but didn't want to confront it. I told her I would like to be friends still, and I meant it. We have been building a healthy non physical friendship since then, and it has added to how good my life has been Recently. She has been a really great friend so far, and I have really enjoyed the process. I admittedly give her some preferential treatment at our property, and I was suspicious that special treatment might be why she started all of this. If that is true, I don't think it would change much. I am kind of a pushover. We don't talk the same ways that we used to, and I miss how shamelessly she hit on me. I miss how nervous she sounded talking to me on the phone.  But until a few days ago, I was able to keep everything compartmentalized.

She put up a status celebrating 6 years of being sober, and in that moment my heart ached for her in a way that surprised the shit out of me. I had no idea that she was sober, and I wanted to call her and tell her how proud I was, and how I would do anything to help. I wanted to tell her that I was glad that she was alive, and I wanted to hear her entire story start to finish so that I would know her better than anyone else. I sent her a message saying congrats, and left it at that. Today, I saw her for the 1st time in a few weeks. She had told me weeks ago that she wanted to see a trashed vacant unit before we cleaned it up, since she is kind of a neat freak. Kinda weird, but I'm 100 percent into that. I let her in there with me to look around, and I was absolutely dumbfounded at how much I missed her. Her body language was completely neutral toward me, and, with immense effort, mine was towards her as well. The ten minutes that we spent inside that apartment where the best ten minutes that I have had in a long time, and when I got back to the office I could hardly do my job.

I knew that I liked this girl. I have for months now, and I have no shame in that. But, I don't just like her anymore, and I am pretty sure that one more fleeting smile is all it is going to take to make me fall in love with someone else's girlfriend. I have no idea how she is dong this to me, and I want it to stop almost as badly as I want it to keep going as long as possible. I shouldn't be anywhere near this girl at any time, but she is absolutely magnetic. She has her claws in me more deeply than I ever thought she could. I am rudderless and losing my sense of control.

441,letter from someone who loves you,"Dear B,

&amp;#x200B;

With such an erratic and faulty memory it's interesting how i can still pinpoint when  and where i'd briefly catch your eyes and innocently smile over two years ago, B..... I can vividly remember every hug we had whether it was awkward and brief, or in the back of a dimlit dingy bar where i actually felt something rare. something special. something that i'd end up pining to feel again even if it was only 10 seconds longer. memories of gazing all slack-jawed at you on my rooftop in those perfect fitting dresses you wear, laughing at all of my horrendous jokes. It was the month of June, back in the summer of 2016, where my mind still hasnt left you (every second, millisecond, nanosecond, picosecond, kiko-second) what frightened me is that i'll never find someone in this world that could compare to the caliber of you. You have this unparalleled natural beauty to you i can drown in, and i've thought that for years..

I find myself stuck in these daydreams of you. of us. Reminiscing on those little innocuous moments i'd have with you. That summer I began waking up everyday excited to maybe see you. Or get a call with the chance that you wanted to hang out again even as 'friends'. I felt that connection. I felt the reciprocation. I felt it deep under the skin. I felt you breathing under my pores and sweating through my glands.... Being struck by cupids crossbow was better than any MDMA ive ever tried. It was all fucking natural. 

&amp;#x200B;

Around that time you gave me the courage to fully express myself. To start writing songs, to paint my innermost thoughts. Every time i'd close my eyes i could create a masterpiece of you. I could create a slideshow of you set to the score composed of heart strings. Create a flipbook simulating with every page an image of you flashing your gorgeous smile framed on your perfect face.

&amp;#x200B;

When we separated, due to unfortunate and misunderstood circumstances my heart grew weary. The lingering past began eating me from the inside gnawing at and sense of hope i had of riding this time away from you out smoothly. I began self medicating to numb over-analyzed past wounds via booze. I sank ship wading water for a few months to finally step up and take care of a responsibility. To prove to myself that i could commit to health with good will. To prove to myself that ill be ok and that im worth it. that i deserve happiness. I've some how managed to stay away from alcohol for over a year and a half, learning how to face deep seated issues head on. A feat! An accomplishment!  

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past two years since i've last seen you, its been like a hands on comprehensive study of human behavour. Explicitly, a cathartic human study of my own behavior, observing patterns of failed relationships, jobs, even all of those basic human errors i felt defined my life..Learning what inuition is..

&amp;#x200B;

still to this day after peeling all the layers of insecurity, self perceived defects, false sense of self... with my innerself exposed and naked, i dig in and pull out true COMPASSION and...I pull out you, b. I pull you out everytime.

&amp;#x200B;

i think you pulled me out b. of whatver funk ive been in all these years, youve pulled me out.

i love you beautiful.

You’ll never know what I feel from you, I wish you’d see from my sight those times. I will and still remember every bit of your presence in my life even though It fade away by leaps and bounds. The world never looked so beautiful, the colors never been brighter..but besides those feelings that anyone who has been hit by Cupid can experience, I never felt that alive before. Kissing you made me feel for the first time like something running through my veins, like the waves beating cliffs..harsh and vivacious. Heaven was the place where I stand by your side. There is something inside me fight on behalf of you everyday to not be forgotten. She must be a shield maiden or something because even your acts make me sick and get me to the edge of collapse. For those who still question the existence of love, love is exist and I am a victim of it. My soul has shattered in millions of pieces, a grandiose feeling yet making me so detached from my body which hinder me to live. I am literary a ghost since the day we were together last time.

Chained by my passion 

Although when she smiles

She makes me feel weightless 

My words stumble upon each other 

For I can not speak when she looks at me 

Because all I want to do is tell her I love her unconditionally

To tell her I love her Heart

Her Soul

Her Dreams

Yet as I lie here now

The only thing I can think of 

Is how I should not burden her. 

For she has bigger things to worry about.

I wish she knew that I care for her so 

Its both a blessing and a curse to feel everything so deeply.

460,HELPPPP,"So im gonna start with some contextualization. Be me, 15 years old, walks into a Personal Finance class after AP Physc. She walks in, her hair is curly, wears the cutest vans and sweater vest and Levi’s. She instantly catches my attention. We both know each other, we are in the marching band. I Spent all this time thinking she hated me and try to ignore her. Then we sit next to each other. I learn something new in that class. It’s not how stocks or credit works or whatever; I learn that the perfect girl is right there, just sitting next to me. She talks in the prettiest and most sophisticated manner, but her self esteem is low and she doesn’t know she’s one of the most talented, prettiest and smartest girl I’ve ever met. Flash forward a couple months. We start talking as FRIENDS. OMG have I thought that I had hit the friend zone hard. I try to get her off my mind, but nothing works to no avail. I start talking to her friends afterwards cuz you know, friend group. I put off my feelings for a while until the summer. Summer comes, we texted on snap occasionally but have never seen each other face to face in 3 months. It’s band camp. I akwardly ask her to see mama Mia 2, but not directly just so I don’t scare her off. At the time I thought she was disgusted or she thought I was a creep cuz she said no. I later learned she said no because she didn’t know how to respond, cuz she liked me a lot. I didn’t know. Flash forward even more into the 1st week of band camp. We talk even more but not to the point of where I could ask her out. Go to the first day of school. I have 4 CLASSES WITH HER, ALL AP. I couldn’t have felt more happier in my life. Maybe it will work out. It’s  a marching competition and me and the boyz, and girls, all go out to eat at some mid end Mexican restaurant in our towns center after we completely sweep all awards. I tell everyone about my feelings about her and they tell me to ask her out. I’m scared and my knees are shaking. And just as things couldn’t get better, there she is. Flute girl, in front of the fountain by the park we were hanging out at just sitting there, with the sunset blinding my eyes from her prettiness. (I told her friends I wanted to ask her out) Me and all my friends devise a plan to ask her out to HOCO. We all get out phones out and each spell a letter. We awkwardly stand in front of her and her friends and SPELL out homecoming with our phones. With me as a question mark. You might not know that it was me asking her out, but she knows. And apparently one of her friends told her. It’s junior year and things just get better. We started going out a week later and it got awkward. (Neither of us has had an actual relationship before) I finally catch my first “kiss” after HOCO. (It was a kiss in the cheek and it was pretty one sided) We start acting like a couple more and kinda have a connection, like she always made me happy and she was all that mattered to me. Flash forward 2 months later and she breaks up with me. The world started falling apart and everything got bad. My parents wanted to get a divorce and separate me and my sister and I had seasonal depression ( I know, stupid). Her reason was “I’m too stressed and lazy to put any effort in the relationship, and I think it is more fun if we hang out as friend” This girl never lies and she is honest, so ima go take her word on that. We still kinda talk, but not as much as we did before we started dating and when we started dating. It’s kinda bad now. I want to ignore her now cuz I know if I hang out with her I’m going to fall into the same trap again. And I want to hang out with her again. She is literally my emotional suicide. And I still love this girl. It’s been three weeks and we still talk and I still hang out with her friends (my friends too) during lunch and classes, but I can’t seem to talk to her down the hall or hang out with her, just me and her (or even in the friend group). What should I do, should I do what makes me happy and attempt to rekindle the fire that was blown out by her desires, or should I do what makes her happy and stay away (cuz her happiness and comfortability are what still matter to me the most).

We make 5 years soon and time has flown by. All I can say is thank you. 

At this point you know how loveless I grew up. The abuse and the bullying. You have spent many nights and days holding me when I could not hold myself. 
Thank you

You taught me what happened was not okay.
Thank you. 

The day you meet me, you showed me what genuine goodness was. You never mocked me, or teased me maliciously. Your words were strong but sweet, your eyes stern but sincere. And I could have sworn you were not from this world. 
Thank you for showing me what love is. 

What love is without conditions. 
Without the “if you don’t do this your not enough” 
You’ve never given me a cold shoulder. 
Your hands have always been warm to hold. 
They have never hurt me. I used to flinch when you’d pat my head, now I lean in to cuddle. 

Thank you. 

For the first 16 years of my life. I didn’t know what love was. I thought the world was supposed to be empty. My love. You brought color back into my eyes. And hope for a better future. 

I have a million reasons why I love you. A million reasons aren’t enough to express the kind of human being you are. I’ve never seen such a pure soul. 
I wish you weren’t so harsh on yourself. I wish you didn’t judge yourself so much and I wish you could tell me the guilt and shame you carry instead of bottling it inside because it would never change how I see you. 
Thank you for honoring me with the chance to be in your life. 

You are my best friend and my lover. There is not a single thing I would change about you. Not your stubborn ness, not your tendency to over sleep and be late on our dates, not even your tendency to eat my food once you’ve finished yours. That says a lot, I don’t let ANYBODY touch my food.

My love, my life. I wanna be your wife. I want to be home when you come back from work. I want to keep your bed warm and our place clean. 
Call me old fashioned, but I would wake up every morning just to make myself beautiful for you. And I would massage your back when you ache, I would rub your feet after a long day. I would prepare all our meals and make sure your food is never cold. 
But I would also play video games with you, shoot you with a nerf gun. Travel And always be ready to offer you the best pleasures in life. 

It would be an honor to have your children. And in sickness or in health. I promise to love you. Because you are the embodiment of love itself. 

you are the embodiment of love itself. 

Don’t you ever forget.

Thank you.

481,"I really think that I’m starting to fall in love, but it’s so early that I’m doubting myself","I’ve only known this girl for (just under) three weeks and I genuinely think that I’m starting to fall in love with her. Every time I see her my feelings just get stronger and stronger, but I feel like it is way too early. I’ve been in love before and it was quite a while ago, but I think I at least somewhat can tell the difference between this and infatuation. I traced a little drawing and she asked for one, but I didn’t tell her that I wanted hers to actually be good so I watched a tutorial and spent almost two hours on it. I don’t even draw as a hobby, but I was so happy doing it. After I sent her a picture of the drawing, she posted a screenshot of something on her phone and I noticed that it’s her lock screen. Last night I think we went through a new barrier because we texted for over a hour while she was going through it emotionally. I think that the way we both expressed things to each other showed just how strong of compatibility we had. I feel like (and hope) I did a good job comforting her through worries and overthinking things and I tried really hard to make her feel valid. She really opened up with telling me what she was worrying about and even though she was in a sad mood, she was so respectful about it and didn’t bring me down at all. I think we both left that emotional space feeling much better. Oh she also has a thread of songs that she likes and has sent me a few songs and I made a playlist of all of them called “Her name’s favorite songs”. I listen to it so much because 1. she has a good taste of music and 2. I like to hear lyrics that I really like knowing that she probably likes that line too.

486,How can i wait for her to feel comfortable with me?,"&amp;#x200B;

tl:dr I really like this girl who im good friends with and we both agree that we get along with really well, and i want to spend more time with her, but she wants things to happen naturally and im left waiting until she's comfortable enough to spend time alone with me.

I found this girl who I get along with really well. Like its weird how well we get on. We like all the same things and just have really good chemistry.

We've been good friends for a couple of months, and i've started to really like her (like the big L-word like her). She knows I feel this way and she herself said that she likes me too and wants to be close, and that she's never gotten on with someone as well as we have, and that shes told me personal things that she hasnt told anyone else here. She says she really cares about me.

i do want a relationship, but for now im fine with just hanging out for now so i keep trying to come up with ideas to hang out together, like going over uni work together or having a movie night.

but she's not sure about doing things like that. she says it takes her a long time to trust people, because she's had things happen to her in past relationships and for now we should just take it slow and let things happen naturally. It's been months of seeing eachother in groups and getting along and texting, but shes really hesitant about doing things with just me. She thinks im trying to rush things along and she only wants a relationship when it comes naturally and lets things happen.

I appreciate that its not the end of the world and things might still happen between us some day, but that could take months or even years. I really like her and want spend time with her, but i can't for now and have to keep waiting for something that could take a long time if ever. It's really hurting me that i can't be with her all the time and be alone together, and just have to settle for talking in groups and texting. If it was just a straight rejection then i'd be really sad but i could at least move on, but now ive just got to hold on waiting for her to feel comfortable enough to spend more time with me.

What should I do about this situation? How can i cope? I could just move on but I really like what we have and i think shes perfect in every way.",love,1543523257,Fegumag,0,1,True,2018-11-29

489,P.S. to the SongWriter,"You should love that girl with the guitar because she seems sad in a way that can be cheered with midnight phone calls and dark chocolate hearts. Like a t-shirt, her sadness can be washed, discarded, destroyed. It’s not a part of her skin, not a barrier to wear between you and her. When you ask her what’s wrong, her voice won’t wither in her throat. If she can’t sing, she’ll strum her guitar. If she can’t strum, she’ll find some means to speak—a carrier pigeon, a dead canary out of a coal mine. 

The Guitar Girl won’t use your lips to seal herself, won’t let the pleasure of your bodies distract from her truths. She won’t burn your chest with her cold hands, or give you a hand job during Happy Feet, or kiss you deep in the snow. Or maybe she will. Maybe she’ll kiss your forehead with the back of her hand and feed you apple slices cut with a butter knife. Maybe she’ll paint a found seashell acrylic gold and enclose it in a box, inking it with *I love you* and *Forever &amp; Always.* 

Will you recognize the lie? That *Forever* isn’t a fear she can yet brave, that when she gifts you the shell, she wants it all back—the shell, the box, the forever, but you open it and kiss her as the guilt congeals at the base of her throat. Should she laugh? Should she cry? Should she feel worse that you are the one who makes her feel better? That when you tell her how beautiful she is, how funny, how sexy, how smart, she feels electrified, her smile like a light bulb that you twist tighter into the socket of her soul. How you distract her from her problems with jokes, like *Don’t worry. When we’re divorced I’ll let you see the kids.* Will you know how much you make her laugh? So much, it almost scares her just like when you say things like how you’d like to be with her for a long time. What is “a long time” she wonders. What does that really mean? Is it like forever? She thinks of all the houses she’s lived in, all the people who change, who leave. 

She knows that she’s one of them, that someday—she will leave you, and she’s sorry. She’s sorry for painting your nails pink and telling your dad about it. She’s sorry that he got mad at you for it. She’s sorry for the night under the streetlamp, that she knew what to do for you to say you loved her, that she was terrified of it, of you, of herself, of letting you love her, of not letting you love her. She’s sorry that you had to leave each other, that you had to not love each other to be the people you would become. She’s sorry that she won’t say these things to you, that she’ll ink them like everything else only to fold them between her ribs where your fingers won’t fit between her bones.   
And I’m sorry too—that I’ve jumbled the characters. That’s not the Guitar Girl. That’s someone else. Guitar girls don’t leave. Guitar girls aren’t afraid. They’re cool and calm, and they drink Pepsi. They don’t paint seashells or decorate boxes. Guitar girls like guitar boys, and to prove it, this one will write you love songs that always come out sad—stupid since you make her so happy, but she writes them anyways because sometimes guitar girls like to still pretend to be sad. 

When you do love her, which won’t be hard at all, you’ll forget about me. Her smiles will overlap my smiles, and you’ll wonder if I ever did smile with you. Our past will be a room in your brain that you will refurnish with her favorite things—tulips and golden retrievers and a paisley-patterned recliner. As she crosses the threshold with your hands curtaining her eyes, you’ll hardly feel the memories you will lose to make room for her. You won’t think to say goodbye to the movie theater, the snowdrift, or the poorly dismantled apple. You’ll forget how we laughed when the Christmas lights broke apocalyptically from the tape around the ceiling trim of my room, how the colors of the dangling lights tattooed our skin. You will leave the task of remembering to me.

I will wonder then about what I should have done versus what I did do, what I should do now that I don’t do. Had I played the guitar, had I unstrung the words from my throat. Had I told you what I felt when I felt it. Had I not been afraid that you would’ve found my sadness like wet cement, hardening, immobilizing us both. Had I not been afraid that everything was futile—the song lyrics that I painted on my ceiling as utterance of what I felt as if words outside myself could break me apart and glue me back together, but nothing worked—not the painted ceiling, or running barefoot in the snow, or skinny-dipping in the moonlit lake. Everything made me sad. Everything made me cry. When you walked away, when you stayed. Could you not feel the cement hardening behind my ribs that night with the Christmas lights? Maybe you did. Maybe you didn’t. I don’t know, and now, you don’t remember.   
Now we both go years without giving ourselves truly to anyone. You stay in one place, then another. I lift my feet from home after home, city after city, but I still think of your body as a window, for a sad guitar girl to climb through, a girl who will let you shutter the world out. Don't you see that she’ll stake her white-picket fence dreams in your chest and marker the name of your someday kids between your shoulder blades? With her, you’ll feel the future in your skin, not the unexplained past in hers. 

Sometimes when I’m alone curled up cold in bed, I wonder whose window I could climb through, whose shutters would keep me safe, who—if anyone—could strip the sadness from my skin, could unharness the cement from my throat. Could I? Could I, I wonder, be my own passageway out of myself? I don’t know when I’m cold and alone. I don’t know, but here I am, and somewhere, there you are.

490,Need advice for a relationship,"Hey everyone! I am a 18yo boy who didnt have any girlfriend because I thought i didnt have time, money or couldnt find someone that i actually ""loved"". I was using this online language learning app, i had no intentions of searching a date. I met a girl there, like 9 months ago and we talked day and night, every minute of every single day since we met, we are in this situation that right now we basically know every single thing about each other, she knows what i think, i know what she thinks. We always have fun talking eachother, we watch movies, tv series together, we love the same music bands, we have the same ambitions, we have the same view of life. We had a lot of those emotional nights that we basically cried together that we are in different countries and how awesome it would be if we were living in the same city etc. As she accepts that i am a really important person in her life and and thats mutual. I learned that she keeps our emotional texts and important moments on her phone etc. But its been a week that im the thinking this ""friend""ship might be something. I dont know if she feels the same but i really dont want to lose a really good friend just because i had this weird feeling to her, i have never felt like this about a person. This year, we will meet for the first time and a month later we will go to a concert together, and im super excited about those, but i have no intentions about explaining myself bc im scared as i said, so it will be emotional ""friendly"" first meeting. I know we are both 18 and we cant do much about it but this thought is really killing me inside, because i really think that i found my soulmate 1500kms away. It is really early for me to think for this stuff personally, but i really cant stop myself. We dont even live in the same country and there are too many obstacles. I dont even know if she feels the same way. I dont know why i wrote this but i really wanted to express my feelings and doubts. What should i do? Should i just wait and see what happens in the future (probably years) or should I express my feelings that has a risk of losing a person that i care the most?

491,It's the first time I have fallen like this for someone,"I've had some love interests, but I have never experienced feelings this strong for anyone, I want to be by her side always, protecting her and just being her support, ensuring she is forever happy, her looks are completely secondary for me, it's only the inside of her, her true self.

I think I love her and I'm afraid she doesn't feel the same for me, even though her happiness is my happiness, even though I would break my heart in a million pieces, I would let her go.

Maybe I'm blinded, and hurting myself for trivial reasons but she's the only one I want right now, everytime I see her my heart skips a beat, she's so kind, and caretaking, to my eyes she's the most perfect being in existence.",love,1543536525,mipin5,13,1,True,2018-11-29

496,"I am stuck, i need help getting rid of these feelings for her.","I never really liked her to that extent where i will continuously think about her in every little thing i do, when i first met her i liked someone else, i told her about my crush and how much i like her. She helped me overcome those feelings, even though my crush liked me back, she supported us but eventually in all of this she fell for me instead. I felt her texts were getting very emotional lately and i never could dump such a good friend like her who helped me in practically everything. I thought maybe i’ll go along with it to preserve our friendship i accepted her feelings and i told her i liked her back even though i had a crush at that moment. We had night convos, convos lasting for 6 hours.. I slowly started falling for her. I was to shy to confess even though she did and i just told her i like her back but i still felt that my words were weak. After 7 months of continuous text message she finally decided to cut ties with me because of how we were bound in toxic circles and our ego got the best of us. We rarely had convos, even when we did it felt forced and awkward and she couldn’t deal with it. THEN my ego got the best of me and i accepted her farewell like it was nothing, like im better then her and thought she will regret leaving me because of all the help i have been for her but instead i was the one who suffered after realizing what i did. Its been a year since and i am still not over her, i still check up on her secretly to ensure if she’s okay, i keep tabs on her friends and see if none of them are harming her in anyway. She was truly my first love and im trapped. 6 girls have confessed to me after she left but i rejected all of them, knowing how incapable i am and how stupid i am to still love her and think about her to this day. Because of her i have changed drastically, i am way mature then i was, Im always careful not to lead someone else, my personality is changed, im no longer a kid anymore.I need help to control my feelings and forget about her :(",love,1543562089,RGalley,6,1,True,2018-11-30
